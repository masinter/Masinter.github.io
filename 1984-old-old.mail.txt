Thanks for the additional info... I'd still like an official "name and
purpose of meeting"... I presume from your messages that this is a
meeting about common lisp, but is it a meeting of "the common lisp
committee" or just for information? If there are votes taken, do I get a
vote? etc.

For the record, Dave Dyer works for Symbolics, if you want a rep from
ISI you should get someone else.

The official name is:

	``DARPA Common Lisp Meeting''

The meeting is being sponsored by DARPA (Squires and Ohlander, specifically).
I believe that they will discuss DARPA's policies regarding Common Lisp. Some
technical issues will be aired, but I presume that the CL Big 5 will make most
of those decisions. An Executive Committee will be formed, which will probably
be the Big 5 and Ohlander as chairman.

Here is what Ohlander said about it most recently:

    It is also important that the world gets informed on what DARPA's plans
    and policies are.  I don't want to delay in making this known.  As you may
    or may not know, some companies are making waves about supporting Common
    Lisp, which is OK with me.  The problem is that they object to us levying
    CL as a standard.  I want to nip these problems in the bud and take a
    position that will be hard for us to back down from.

    It is important that we have a public forum and general meeting so that
    people cannot come back later and complain that they had no chance to
    participate.  Once we do this, I expect that a small number of people 
    will do the real work, as usual.

My specific goal in inviting you (and Xerox) is to be sure that you (and Xerox)
cannot claim to be left out of this meeting. You (and Xerox) will receive a
written invitation any day now, from DARPA.

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Klamath
Star 3.3MR requires the Klamath System Software release.

Display Font Files
All display font files now have the extension '.StarFont' applied to the data file names. See the installation document for details.

STAR Documents
Star document version compatibility is consistent with major release standards. Star Documents from OS 4.0 (Star 3.0), OS4.1 (Star 3.1), OS 4.2 (Star 3.2), Star 3.2IRKlamath (StarK), and 3.2irVTb (VT100 pre-release) are automatically converted to OS 5.0 (Star 3.3) when the documents are opened on an OS 5.0 desktop or Upgraded to OS5 via the desktop menu command. Star documents from releases prior to OS 4.0 should be upgraded to one of the above mentioned versions before adopting Star 3.3MR. OS 5.0 Star documents are not recognized by any earlier version of Star. Documents created in earlier versions of Star 3.3 which contain fields or tables need to be paginated (not simple paginate) before using.
	
STAR Record Files
Record files from all previous versions will be converted to Star 3.3 format when they are first opened. Star 3.3 record files will not be usable on any earlier version. There are no known problems in converting old record files to Star 3.3. However, for the duration of System Test we recommend copying your old record files before first opening them in Star 3.3. If the converted record file opens correctly, and you can Show View Properties on each view, then the original may be deleted. If the Open or Show View Properties fails, then the original unconverted record file should be referenced as the Test Case in an AR.

STAR Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets from 3.1 and 3.2 have the same format in Star 3.3.

STAR Floppy Disks
Star 3.2 floppy disks are readable on Star 3.3. The data objects transferred from the floppy to the desktop will still adhere to the compatibility restrictions listed above. Star 3.2 and earlier versions will not read Star 3.3 floppy disks.

STAR Desktops
The combination of converting to Klamath, Filing, Clearinghouse, new document format, new character set standard, and expanding the Star system volume size causes desktop compatibility to be somewhat less than straightforward. Details on retaining desktop data are contained in the Installation.doc referenced below. 

Compatibilty with Basic Workstation
Basic Workstation 2.0 is compatible with Star 3.3MR with respect to Services facilities. Basic Workstation 2.0 and Star 3.3MR can share the same user volume.

Compatibility with Services 8.0
Star 3.3MR can communicate only with services using Services 8.0 software (OS 5.0). Servers running Services 7.0 are now quite rare within OSD.



RESTRICTIONS
===========
Please read the detailed restrictions in:
 
	[Rain]<AlphaStar>3.3MR>Doc>Restrictions.doc  --3 pages.

General restrictions are:

1. Star 3.3 will require about 1500 more disk pages for system usage than Star 3.2. Necessary architectural extensions provided in the Klamath System Software release resulted in approximately a 500 page growth in the stored bootfile. Conversion to the latest Xerox Character Set Standard resulted in a 500 page growth in the display fonts file. New feature added to Star 3.3 has resulted, thus far, in a 500 page growth in the bootfile. Physical volume repartitioning will be required for most users. Details are in the Installation.doc referenced below.

Suggested minimum system volume sizes as a function of disk size. These numbers are for customer configurations only and are computed assuming that the whole disk being devoted to Star. All persons having previously converted to OS5.0 need not repartition their disk.

10MB: 6700 pages
29MB: 8000 pages
42MB: 9000 pages

2. This is not a restriction but is listed here to get your attention. The display font files (*.StarFont) need to be loaded in a specific order so that overriding of characters common to multiple display files will be accomplished as advertised. This happens automatically for our customers in the floppy installation process. Those of us who load with the StarFile tool or other means must load the the display fonts in the following order - AStar followed by JStar followed by CStar.

3. Pre-OS 5.0 desktops stored on an OS 5.0 file service and fetched to an OS 5.0 Star (Star 3.3) will invoke automatic conversion of the filing attributes (most noticeably filename). Read the the upgrade restrictions carefully in Restrictions.doc.

4. While it is possible to send mail notes to older systems, one should be very careful about the characters used to compose the message. Messages should generally be restricted to simple character set 0 ascii characters. In particular, no current characters which are in a character set beyond the last OIS character set should be sent. This could cause the older systems to crash.

5. The user dictionary record files for 3.3MR are incompatible with 3.3I or earlier.

6. Fonts and keyboards have been extensively modified to conform to the new character set standard. It is extremely difficult to correctly make all these changes. Be on the lookout for incorrect characters, missing characters (usually noted by black bokes) and character spacing or widths problems. Please help by sending ARs when such inconsistencies are observed.
	
7. Tektronix 4010 Terminal Emulation is not to be delivered until after OS5.0 engineering release. It is listed as part of OS 5.0 because it will not constitute a separate release, but rather will be a loadable config.

8. Note that the packaging of the screen font files has changed again:
	AStarSmallModern.StarFont = Modern 6pt through 24pt.
	AStarLargeModern.StarFont = Modern 30pt and 36pt.
	AStarClassic.StarFont = Classic 6pt through 24pt.
	AStarPrintwheel.StarFont = Printwheel fonts.
	AStarTerminal.StarFont = Terminal fonts.

AStarClassic.StarFont and AStarPrintwheel.StarFont have replaced AStarStandard.StarFont. Before loading these new font files, users are advised to delete the old ones. The minimum that you MUST load is AStarSmallModern.StarFont and AStarTerminal.StarFont.

Subject: Twelfth Update of Services 8.0 System Test
From: The Services Implementors <Ladner.pa>
To: ServicesSystemTest^.es
Reply-to: Ladner.pa

This message announces the twelfth update (version 8.0p) to Services 8.0 System Test.  It lists the changes made to the software and documentation since the eleventh update of system test, and includes a current version of the original release message.

This update is based on Pilot 11.0m.

This version of Services is the version with which beta test will be started.


CHANGES

The "Start of System Test" message, which follows this update notice, has been modified to be pertinent to this update.


CHANGES TO SYSTEM TEST CONFIGURATION

The system test configuration is essentially unchanged.  Consult the document Services 8.0 System Test Configuration for the current configuration.


CHANGES TO SOFTWARE

Services is supplying its own microcode with this update.  There is on the AlphaServices directory a microcode file that corresponds to the equivalent Pilot microcode file.  These files should be used on all servers using AlphaServices software.

All changes to Services software in this update were in response to the Release Readiness Committee having judged bugs (as represented by ARs) as necessary to be fixed before release.

A change was made to the sorting algorithm for strings in 8.0j.  This is a reminder that to avoid potential failures due to this change, File and Clearinghouse services should be scavenged immediately after installing this version of Services if you are upgrading from a pre-8.0j version.

The following ARs were fixed in this update:

CHS: 6033 7853 9689 10010 10444 10445 10471 10562

Please remember that the AR database is our primary way of keeping track of the many problem reports that we receive during System Test.  We also depend on patterns of problems reported in ARs to develop a global picture of the state of the system and of the progress of System Test.  We cannot keep track of problems reported by word of mouth or by message to random implementors, and therefore we are unable to pay serious attention to problems unless they are documented in ARs.

Sounds good.

Seems to me that the real bug is in any caller that doesn't specify an ONLY.  I have always been confused by the fact that the system somehow seems unwilling to clearly make the distinction between COMS and TYPES, tending to fold them together.

I think this is a design flaw.  In reality, there should be a separate GETFILEPKGCOM distinct from GETFILEPKGTYPE.  Any caller who doesn't want to discriminate (I submit there should be none such) should be forced to explicitly call them both.

In short, I think this whole tempest arises cause of an original conceptual bug:  I think it was Warren who never quite understood that it was an only an accident that many coms had the same name as the type that they dumped.

Well, maybe we'll fix that in a couple of years too.

Let sleeping dogs lie...

cc: Lispcore^

The file {eris}<speech>work>newboxftimes.dcom contains new definitions of the ufns for FTIMES, FQUOTIENT, FPLUS, FDIFFERENCE that enable them to operate on numeric array arguments as well as simple number arguments.  On arrays, they operate elementwise.  They also coerce any integer arrays (word, byte, bit, etc) to floatp before operating.

On the DTiger, the FTIMES of 2 array arguments uses the array opcodes.  (The opcodes for plus and difference are not connected yet.)

Also in this file are generalized definitions for SIN and COS, that accept array arguments, and the new function

(GENVEC INITIAL END BY ORIG) which produces a vector containing the numbers from INITIAL thru END with an interval of BY.  The arrays origin will be ORIG (either 0 or 1, defaults to 1).

(SIN (GENVEC 0 90 15)) gives a vector of the SIN's of 0, 15, 30, 45 ...90 degree angles.

This should be copied (and tested) in the speech sysouts.

From: Peter Deutsch <DEUTSCH@SU-CSLI.ARPA>
Subject: Brief sketch of O
To: Zdybel.pa
cc: MultipleInheritance^.pa
Reply-To: Deutsch.pa

Purpose: the purpose of O is to clean up the unnecessary and confusing
distinctions in Smalltalk-80 between the 5 levels of instantiation
(metaclass, class, instance, activation, block) and between the 6
types of variable (class instance, class, instance, argument,
temporary, and pool).  A secondary purpose is to provide better
support for multiple inheritance and for the functional programming
style.

Disclaimer: although O achieves these purposes, and also solves two
long-standing problems in the design of Smalltalk languages, its
present design is not innovative enough to satisfy my desires, and
also has one known gigantic problem to which I haven't yet found a
satisfying solution.

World-view: the world is made up of objects.  Objects have the following
parts:
	- a sequence of super-objects from which they inherit (more on
this below).
	- a set of (name, value) pairs.  Both names and values can be
arbitrary objects.
In the current O implementation, the set of super-objects is fixed at the time
an object is created, and (name, value) pairs can be added, but not removed,
after creation.  Neither of these restrictions is intrinsic.

"Magic" is not required to create objects with indexable parts like
strings and arrays, since they can have parts whose names are integers,
but in the current implementation magic is used for such objects.
Magic is, however, required for some small set of fundamental objects
(probably only small integers).

Programs: programs have an external syntax resembling Smalltalk-80
(although currently tweaked for easier typing into the Lisp substrate
which O runs on) and an internal syntax which is a tree of objects.
The leaves of the tree are variables and constants; the non-leaves are
message sending, sequencing, assignment, construction (rebinding),
and closure creation.  The external syntax has a construct for function
call, but it is converted into a message send, e.g.
	FUNC(a;b)
is equivalent to
	FUNC VALUE.WITH: a WITH: b

Variables are represented by their names.  There are three lexical
syntaxes for variables:
	- identifiers (letter followed by 0 or more letters, digits,
and/or dots).
	- binary operators (one or more binary operator characters,
chosen from !@$^&*-=+`~\,<>/?).
	- keywords (one or more sequences consisting of an identifier
followed by a colon).
Note that A:B: is a single variable name.

Constants are integers, floating point numbers, strings enclosed in
double quotes, or # followed by either a variable name (which denotes
a symbol constant) or a parenthesized list of constants (with any
inner #s omitted), which denotes a list constant (strictly speaking,
zero or more pair constants linked together and terminated by a null
constant).  There are no character constants, or indeed character
objects: characters are represented by one-character symbols.

Message sending is as in Smalltalk-80, with one vital difference:
the message name is interpreted not as a constant symbol, but as a
variable name.  Thus the expression
	3+4
is interpreted as "send the message which is the current binding of
the name + to the object 3 with the argument 4".

Sequencing is as in Smalltalk-80.

Assignment is as in Smalltalk-80.

Construction / rebinding has the form
	object variable.name _ new.value
It constructs a new object which is a copy of object with variable.name
bound to new.value.

Closure creation is like block creation in Smalltalk-80, except that
the argument variables are properly scoped.  The syntax also provides
for giving the function (closure) a local name, allowing easy creation of
recursive functions.

Funny stuff: global, permanently defined objects are named through a
hack using Lisp property lists.  A symbol can appear on a super-object
list, and is interpreted as an indirect reference to a global object
with that name.  This should really be handled, as in T, by editing a
global object from which all objects inherit.

Interpretation: the most interesting thing about interpretation is how
variable names are interpreted, and how contexts (activations) are
represented.  A context is just an object that inherits from CONTEXT
*and* from the receiver of the message that created the context.
Its names are just the argument names of the method.  (There are no
temporaries: if you want temporaries, make an anonymous inner function,
e.g. instead of
	| t |
	t _ something.
	...
use
	:(t | ...)(something)
just as in Lisp without PROG or LET.)  Contexts also have two specific
names SENDER, the sender's context, and CONTINUATION (probably misnamed),
the expression (subtree) being evaluated.

Variable names are looked up in the current context using the LOOPS
search rule, i.e. enumerate the super-object tree in depth-first order,
taking the first binding for the name, but discarding all but the
*last* visit to any particular node.  For example, in the inheritance
tree
	  A
	  |
	  B
	 / \
	C   D
	 \ /
	  E
a lookup starting at E would search E, C, (B), (A), D, B, A, where the
first visits to B and A are skipped.  This provides proper overriding
of older by newer definitions in all cases.

The result of this search rule is that argument names are found in the
context object itself; instance variable names are found in the receiver,
from which the context inherits; class instance and class variable names
are found in the appropriate ancestors of the receiver (there are no
classes per se, only prototype objects); pool variables are handled
through additional ancestors of the prototype.

Message/function duality: the values of variables like +, MIN:, ABS,
etc. are selector objects.  Selectors have an arity, and are identity
objects (= is synonymous with ==).  Normally the value of + would be
a symbol selector (whose super-objects are SYMBOL and SELECTOR).
Furthermore, selectors define the appropriate VALUE.WITH:[WITH:]*
message, so that selectors can be applied as functions, e.g.
	(SELECTOR) VALUE.WITH: arg1 WITH: arg2
is defined as
	arg1 PERFORM: (SELECTOR) WITH: arg2
As a result, +(3;4) is exactly equivalent to 3+4.  The converse is not
necessarily true, since there is no *requirement* that names used as
messages be bound to selector objects.

Private messages: if a class or group of classes want to have private
messages within themselves, they just arrange to inherit from an object
that rebinds the names of the messages to new selector objects.

THE KNOWN PROBLEM: consider an object like PAIR, which has parts named
FIRST and REST.  Within a method defined for PAIR, these parts can be
accessed by name.  However, from the outside, they must be accessed by
some other name, because X FIRST is equivalent to FIRST(X), which
requires that FIRST be bound to a selector or function.  This is already
a nuisance.  Furthermore, one would like to have active values, so that
one can write SIZE instead of SELF SIZE, and have a method run if SIZE
is defined procedurally for the current object.  Unfortunately,
as just observed, an object can't have the same name usable as both a
part name and a message name: if there is a part named SIZE, the object
can't even *send* the message normally called SIZE.

Current status: there is an implementation that pretty much runs.
It still uses symbols for messages, so it doesn't have the just-mentioned
problem.  All the code I've written so far, except for some string- and
file-manipulation code, is functional.  Iteration is done with approx-
imately the Smalltalk-80 constructs, built out of an ingenious double-
recursive implementation of coroutines (continuation passing).  As a
result of this, among other things, the implementation is glacially slow.

Prospects: I'm looking around for a different way to think about compu-
tations.  My current candidate is reduction of systems of processes
(a la Concurrent Prolog, constraint propagation systems, rule-based
systems (or at least one way of looking at rule systems), and problem
solvers).  I believe there is a way to recast all the stuff I've done
so far into this light, and gain a lot of interesting flexibility.
If I ever find a way to make time to talk with Brian Smith, I suspect
it would be pretty easy to make the system reflective (I already use
a special-purpose reflectivity trick to make program execution work
by sending an EVALUATE.IN: message to each node of the program tree.)

Disclaimer: no claims are made that the above is consistent, well-
organized, or tremendously original.  It's been fun, it seems like a
significant simplification of Smalltalk-80, and it's been interesting
since I haven't programmed with multiple inheritance before.

I hope somebody out there has some interesting comments on all this --
it took me long enough to write it!

P.S. Does anybody know about a language called Tau?  Somebody mentioned
it to me recently and I've forgotten the reference.

I know that either a type or command are acceptable to a number of functions (WHEREIS, SHOWDEF, etc.), but to tell you the truth, I don't know why.  The fact that I could move "VARS" commands from one file to another just doesn't make sense to me.  I can believe moving definitions of type variable, but not commands that happen to have that name.  If I say to move FOO where FOO is a command, not a type, does that mean to move the kinds of types that FOO would dump?

This is precisely the lurking confusion that has been in there since 1978.  I think that it stems from the fact that some types have commands of the same name, which means that you can perform lots of type-based operations on what look like command names--but you are really performing them on the type of the same name.  We then generalized from this accidental ambiguity and came to the conclusion that somehow we must be able to treat all commands, even ones that do not also name types, as types for some number of operations.

If I'm missing something here, please set me straight and end all these years of confusion!

I am not interested in bring Franz Lisp up on dandelions.
I would guess that if Interlisp were not available, some undergraduate
hacker might take it upon himself to try such a thing.

I would much rather use Interlisp, as delivered.  Neither I nor my
current research group is dependent on Franz, particularly, though we
are using it as a convenience, for implementation of a p-code interpreter.
I still suspect that a microcoded interpreter (perhaps coexisting with
Interlisp) would be a good way of doing algebraic manipulation.

I talked to Gary Moskovitz in Xerox AIBS (?) in Pasadena, who says he
cannot give us INterlisp at below his cost, though he would love to have
us use it.  He suggested we press our contacts in the University grants
area for additional support.

He also said that the Dandetiger upgrades should be available for $$
at some university discount, or that we might try to get the upgrades in a subsequent
grant program.

Last edited by	Diebert:   September 20, 1984 9:47:11 am PDT

The Cedar Archive System is intended to replace the Archive/Interrogate functions on MAXC.  This document describes the system and proposes further enhancements.
The system consists of 5 major players.
1.  The TapeServer that is resident on the net.
2.  The IFS or other file server that talks the FTP protocol.
3.  The Grapevine electronic mail system.
4.  The host upon which the Archivist program runs.
5.  The human operator.  The keeper of the archives.

The User Interface
The user in order to store or retrieve files from archive, sends a message, of the approximate flavor as shown, to the GV RName of the local Archivist service.  In the CSL case, this RName is Archivist.pa.
Besides the to: from: and other message header garbage, the message has a keyword structure that at the present time must follow the specified form.

Archiving
The message body will contain an entry of the following flavor for each file to be archived.  An entry might be:
Archive: [ivy]<Diebert>Junk>*.*
Archive: [indigo]<Archivist>MessageLog.tioga!2
Archive: /ivy/Diebert/Junk/User.cm

Both FTP bracket syntax and Cedar FS slash syntax for file names are accepted.  The following constructs are equivalent:
[server]<rootDirectory>subDirectory>simpleName!version
/server/rootDirectory/subDirectory/simpleName!version
The structural characters that delimit the server part of a file name are "[" and "]", or "/".  Non-structural characters allowed in the server part are all alphanumeric characters plus ".", "$", "-", "+", "'" and "#".  The structural characters allowed in the rest of an file name are "<" and ">", or "/".  The non-structural characters are the same as for the server part with the exception of "#".  The additional structural character "!" is used as the version part prefix.  The rest of the version part can be a number in the range [1 .. 65534], or one of the letters "L" or "H".  Case is not significant in file name.  The version letter "L" specifies that the lowest available version number should be used while the "H" represents that the highest version number should be used.  If the version number is not specified the highest version will be used.
Wild card substitution is valid in requests for Archive.  If the enumeration of the wild cards yields a null list, the requester's message is returned with an explanation as to why the request can't be processed.
If a user wishes to archive a particular version (as shown in the second example) of a file he/she must supply the complete information in the request message.
In general duplicate requests for archives will not be honored.  In order to archive a file twice a message must be sent to the Archivist making the request.
Two copies of the file are made independently and on different drives so that the likelyhood of a hardware problem are minimized.

Retrievals
The retrieval message is very similar to the archive message.  
Retrieve: [ivy]<Diebert>User.cm!2 of 10-Oct-83 06:27:43 from T10027P or T10027B
Retrieve: /ivy/Diebert/User.cm!2 of 10-Oct-83 06:27:43 from T10027P or T10027B as /ivy/Diebert/RetrievedStuff/OldUser.cm

In the first example, the requester has supplied the full name of the file to be retrieved as well as the create time of the file to be retrieved.
The second example is for a retrieval to a file name different than the one the file was archived as.  This is available only if the requester is the same as the archive requester and that the file will end up in a directory under the original requesters control.
It should be noted that the version number that was supplied at the time the file was archived is not of any use in the retrieval of the file, however it must be supplied.  Since the version number is connected with the file server's instance of the named file it is not really part of the file itself.  Version numbers are inconsistent (because the file they represent can be deleted and when the file is restored, it may have a version number much lower than the current highest level) and therefore are only used for getting the file from the file server in the first place.

General
In both the archive and retrieve requests, the requester is notified by a message of the action taken by the Archivist and its keeper.  
Archive requests are acknowledged with the following information.  Each file that was obtained from the enumeration of the wild cards is listed in the returned message.  In addition to the file name, the system will give the creation time that was gotten from the IFS and the volIds of both the primary and backup media that the file is archived on.
The system maintains a large log of all of the archive transactions performed by the Archivist.  From this log information, it maintains for each file server a master archive directory in the form of a B-Tree.  A copy of this directory is always available as [FileServer]<Archivist>ArchiveDirectory.BTree!H.  The B-Tree is maintained in the format that was designed by Ed McCreight and that is used, among other places, by IFS and the Cedar BTree package.  Therefore, packages to query it from various programming environments should be straightforward to build.  See the interface ArchivistBTree.mesa for a more detailed description of the archive-specific structure of this file, and [Indigo]<Cedar@>Documentation>BTreeDoc.Tioga for the best description of the BTree package.
In addition to sending acknowledgment messages and maintaining the master directory log/tree structures, every time files are archived from a directory on a file server, an updated version of the entire archive history for that directory is stored on that directory as a plain text file.  This file is not required by the system and may be deleted by the user; it is intended as a simple means for finding out what's archived and for composing requests.  When the B-Tree query facilities are mature, we will consider eliminating these individual archive directories.
Errors are reported as soon as they can be detected.
It is against the rules for a person to make retrieve request from a directory that is not his.  There exists the ability to have a file renamed and placed on a different file server, however the facility is only available to the original owner of the file.  Special request will have to be made to retrieve files from departed peoples directories.
Media
The archive system is designed around the idea of media volume IDs rather than tape numbers as the MAXC system uses.  At first the media will be magnetic tape, however there is no reason whatsoever to limit the system volume ID stuff just to tapes.

How it works
Format of the media
The format of the physical media has been decided for the tape media.  The plans for optical disk media, at this point are just plans.
Tape format
The tape format used by the archivist consists of 4 record types.  The first record on the tape is always a Volume record which describes the physical properties of the tape as well as its volID.  Files stored on the tape consist of 2 different record types always present as pairs, that is that each file is preceded by a Directory record which describes the file and contains the property list from the IFS and one or more Data records hold the actual file data.  The last record on the tape is a Status record recording the amount of tape left and the sequence numbers to use once processing is resumed.  All records of different types are separated by tape marks.
All records have a sequence number which is checked on reads to insure that the tape integrity has not be compromised.  In addition there is a file number associated with a file and a block number within that file number.
The tape has the following format.  It should be noted that the real truth about the format lives in the interface module TapeArchiveMedia.mesa.

TapeRecord: TYPE ~ MACHINE DEPENDENT RECORD
[
fileNumber: CARDINAL _ 0, -- check of the file sequencing on the tape

Building and Processing the Queues
The queues
The system makes use of a number of plain text files called queues.  The queues are the:
	Primary.queue
	Backup.queue
	Retrieve.queue
	ErrorMessage.queue
	DoneMessage.queue
These queues represent the state of any request at any time.  All of the names of the queues can be changed by user profile entries.
Building the Primary and Retrieve queues
The following queues are generated by the Walnut mail processing software which will all be automated when WalnutOps is available.  The two queues are:
	Primary.queue	Contains the list of files to be archived.
	Retrieve.queue	This contains a list of files to be retrieved.

The Primary.queue has the following format.  All of the entries are plain text so that they may be repaired, if necessary, by hand.	
	messagePtr: ROPE literal of the GVId from Walnut
	FileName: ROPE
	CreateTime: ROPE
The Retrieve.queue has this format:
	Primary volID: ROPE,
	Backup volID: ROPE,
	File name: ROPE,
	Create Date: ROPE,
	messagePtr: ROPE literal of the GVId from Walnut
	New file name: ROPE if specified
The generation of the queues is done in the following way.
1.	An FS STREAM is opened for append on Primary.queue and Retrieve.queue.
2.	Messages are parsed as to the GVId and the various line requests.
3.	If the request is for archive, any * enumeration is performed and the specified IFS is check for the files existence and create date.  As these files are found the file name, create date and GVId are append to the end of the Primary.queue and an FS Flush is performed to insure that the request makes it to the disk.  In addition the BTree for that file server is checked to see if the file has already been archived.  If it has the keeper is asked if it should be archived again.  If the file is not in the BTree an entry is inserted for it and the state of the request is marked as pending.
4.	If the request is for a retrieve, the request is checked in the BTree (described latter) to see if the file has already be archived, if it has not the information is appended to the Retrieve.queue.
5.	The message is manually moved into the MailProcessed message set in Walnut.  Again this will be automated as soon as WalnutOps becomes available.
6.	When all the mail is processed the various queues are closed.
Processing the Primary.queue
Once the Primary.queue has be established, processing is initiated by the keeper.  The keeper provides the current media volID and processing begins as follows:
1.	The media volume is opened, that is a connection is opened to the tapeserver and the volume information is confirmed.  The volId and volume function are compared to that supplied by the keeper, and if correct, the tape is scanned until the Status record is found.
2.	Once the volume is opened and positioned, the Primary.queue, Backup.queue and ErrorMessage.queue are opened.
3.	The Primary.queue is read to get the next file to archive and the directory information is written onto the tape.  The file is then transferred to the tape.  If an error occurred during this operation the tape position is corrected, to maintain the sequence of the tape, and an error message is generated and placed into the ErrorMessage.queue.  If the operation was successful the Primary.queue entry is appended to the Backup.queue.  The Backup.queue has the same format as the Primary.queue except that the Primary volID is added as the last field.
4.	When the Primary.queue is exhausted without filling the volume, a Status record is written onto the tape as an end of tape marker and a record to tell how much tape is left.  If the volume is filled without the Primary.queue being exhausted, the remaining entries in the Primary.queue are written to a new Primary.queue and primary processing stops.
5.	After the volume is closed, the BTree for the various requests if updated with the volID of the primary media, and the file entry is marked as backup pending.
Processing the Backup.queue
The Backup.queue is processed in the same way as the Primary.queue with the exception that finished requests are placed into the DoneMessage.queue.
Processing the Retrieve.queue
The Retrieve.queue is processed in a fashion somewhat differently than the two archive queues.  Before any processing is performed the queue is sorted into volume order and a request is made for the keeper to mount the specified volume.  Once this is done the volume is opened and the volID verified.  The queue is then read into a list of all files to be retrieved from this volume and the volume is searched for the files.  When a file is located, the target IFS is interrogated to see if the file name and version already exist.  If it does, the file is renamed to the next highest available version number.  If the file does not exist the file is restored using its original version number even if this version would be after the highest version. (ie.  version 4 exists and version 9 has been request to be retrieved.)  If the users page allocation is exceeded by the retrieval, the retrieve will be performed anyway but the page allocation will not be changed, therefore any large file put into the users account which uses up his allocation is his problem.  If a particular file is not located on the volume and the file is in the BTree, it is a very good possibility that the BTree is smashed and needs to be rebuilt.  After the file is retrieved a message is composed and placed into DoneMessage.queue.
The Message queues
Information that is needed to be sent back to the requestor are place into either the DoneMessage.queue or the ErrorMessage.queue based upon the contents of the message.  The format of these queues are:
	messagePtr: ROPE literal of the GVId from Walnut,
	Message: ROPE
The ErrorMessage.queue is processed by mearly constructing a message to each user specified in the queue.
Processing the DoneMessage.queue
The DoneMessage.queue is process in the following steps.
1.	The queue is sent to the requestor as one or more messages.  (Multiple messages are sent when the response would create a return message greater than 30000 characters.)
2.	The queue is used to update the global BTrees kept for each IFS involved in the Archivist activity.
3.	A new plain text archive directory is constructed for each requestor for this session from the global BTree and it is placed onto the IFS involved.
4.	The queue is then formatted as a log file and is used as part of the forever transaction log.
The BTrees
A global BTree is kept for each IFS involved in the Archivist function.  It is created and update using the Cedar BTree package and is created with the file name and create time of the file as the index and the volume IDs of the media as the data.  The BTrees are updated as indicate in the queue processing descriptions.  These BTrees will be kept in a public place with unlimited read access to valid IFS users.  These BTrees are assumed to be the truth about what is where, and is consulted prior to making archives and retrieves.  These trees can be reconstructed from the transaction log files.
The BTree contains the following information about the files.  The tree is keyed on the full file name and create time in plain text form.  The data associated with this key consists of:
	A status entry:  {primary pending, backup pending, done}
	A text string describing the volumes that the file is archived on.
The BTrees can be constructed in a number of ways.  The first is to use the master logs to reconstruct the trees.  This will reconstruct the trees to a state that contains only those request that have been completed.  The pending information can be constructed from the Primary.queue and the Backup.queue.
The plain text archive directory
The format of the archive directory kept on each IFS directory involved in archives is:
File Name including server and directory information,
file create time,
primary volume ID,
backup volume ID
All of these fields are separated by one or more blanks or tabs and terminated with a CR.
The file is made by interrogating the BTree for the IFS and directory and is presented as a single file.  This file has no protection from delete, and does contribute to the users IFS page allocation.  If the directory would overflow the users space, the directory is written and the user is then responsible to delete it or other files to make more space.  If the user does delete this file he can request that a new one be made by the archivist.  These requests will be handled on an as needed basis.

The big reasons we picked the Sun over other 68000 is that is
running the right UNIX 4.2 bsd.  Also they seem very willing and
anxious to see Interlisp on their product.  They seem very
flexible to work out a deal with XSIS.  Also many of our friends
in the community have got Suns already.

The big tasks for putting Interlisp up on the Suns our:

1) redo the code generator and optimizer for the 68000.

2) recode an assembly language module and design the calling
sequence and data structures for the machine.

3) Make sure the C kernel works under Suns' 4.2 bsd.  The last
time I tried this I ran into some problems.

4) redo the garbage collector.  The stop and copy we is not
desirable on the machine due to virtual page limitations (it
might not even fit).

Once we get Interlisp running then another 68000 implementation
should be easy.

The other project member, Mark Feber is considering leaving the
project.

The only "carrot" I have left is the possibility of putting
Interlisp up on the Sun's.  I don't think we can do anything to
influence him in the time frame he is considering but I though
you might want to know what is going on.

Hi,
	I believe it's ok for people to send information on products
to the list, unless they actually work for the company.  In your
case, you could send information on products except Xerox products.
While that sounds rather inconsistant, I would like people to send
information on products they find interesting, but I don't want
submissions that are advertising from a company.  If there is
something that you find interesting from Xerox you should probably
give the information to a friend that doesn't work for Xerox to
submit.  In any case, there should *not* be salesman information.
Any more questions about this, let me know.

Hope this helps,

I hope this didn't blow up in my absence -- I'm reading my mail linearly and your message was a week old. I didn't make very explicit what was happening with Pentland: I asked him to please write a "requirements" document rather than a comparison -- i.e., what he thought Xerox would have to do before the vision researchers at SRI/Fairchild would be happy. MOST of the things that he outlined in his document haven't been committed to. What I wanted was some starting point for us to use in deciding whether it was worth committing the resources to meet their needs. He of course listed EVERYTHING that he thought was going to be important. Note that it didn't include, e.g., MultiBus capability or a number of other things that he *could* have wished for.

(More later on this, I guess, since we do need to respond by early September.)

	===========================

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Klamath
Star 3.3NR requires the Klamath System Software release.

Display Font Files
All display font files now have the extension '.StarFont' applied to the data file names. See the installation document for details.

STAR Documents
Star document version compatibility is consistent with major release standards. Star Documents from OS 4.0 (Star 3.0), OS4.1 (Star 3.1), OS 4.2 (Star 3.2), Star 3.2IRKlamath (StarK), and 3.2irVTb (VT100 pre-release) are automatically converted to OS 5.0 (Star 3.3) when the documents are opened on an OS 5.0 desktop or Upgraded to OS5 via the desktop menu command. Star documents from releases prior to OS 4.0 should be upgraded to one of the above mentioned versions before adopting Star 3.3NR. OS 5.0 Star documents are not recognized by any earlier version of Star. Documents created in earlier versions of Star 3.3 which contain fields or tables need to be paginated (not simple paginate) before using.
	
STAR Record Files
Record files from all previous versions will be converted to Star 3.3 format when they are first opened. Star 3.3 record files will not be usable on any earlier version. There are no known problems in converting old record files to Star 3.3. However, for the duration of System Test we recommend copying your old record files before first opening them in Star 3.3. If the converted record file opens correctly, and you can Show View Properties on each view, then the original may be deleted. If the Open or Show View Properties fails, then the original unconverted record file should be referenced as the Test Case in an AR.

STAR Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets from 3.1 and 3.2 have the same format in Star 3.3.

STAR Floppy Disks
Star 3.2 floppy disks are readable on Star 3.3. The data objects transferred from the floppy to the desktop will still adhere to the compatibility restrictions listed above. Star 3.2 and earlier versions will not read Star 3.3 floppy disks.

STAR Desktops
The combination of converting to Klamath, Filing, Clearinghouse, new document format, new character set standard, and expanding the Star system volume size causes desktop compatibility to be somewhat less than straightforward. Details on retaining desktop data are contained in the Installation.doc referenced below. 

Compatibilty with Basic Workstation
Basic Workstation 2.0 is compatible with Star 3.3NR with respect to Services facilities. Basic Workstation 2.0 and Star 3.3NR can share the same user volume.

Compatibility with Services 8.0
Star 3.3NR can communicate only with services using Services 8.0 software (OS 5.0). Servers running Services 7.0 are now quite rare within OSD.



RESTRICTIONS
===========
Please read the detailed restrictions in:
 
	[Rain|Ibis]<AlphaStar>3.3NR>Doc>Restrictions.doc  --3 pages.

General restrictions are:

1. Star 3.3 will require about 1500 more disk pages for system usage than Star 3.2. Necessary architectural extensions provided in the Klamath System Software release resulted in approximately a 500 page growth in the stored bootfile. Conversion to the latest Xerox Character Set Standard resulted in a 500 page growth in the display fonts file. New feature added to Star 3.3 has resulted, thus far, in a 500 page growth in the bootfile. Physical volume repartitioning will be required for most users. Details are in the Installation.doc referenced below.

Suggested minimum system volume sizes as a function of disk size:

10MB: 6700 pages
29MB: 8000 pages
42MB: 9000 pages

These numbers are for customer configurations only and are computed assuming that the whole disk being devoted to Star. Only users upgrading from OS4.x to OS5.0 need repartition their disk.

2. This is not a restriction but is listed here to get your attention. The display font files (*.StarFont) need to be loaded in a specific order so that overriding of characters common to multiple display files will be accomplished as advertised. This happens automatically for our customers in the floppy installation process. Those of us who load with the StarFile tool or other means must load the the display fonts in the following order - AStar followed by JStar followed by CStar.

3. Pre-OS 5.0 desktops stored on an OS 5.0 file service and fetched to an OS 5.0 Star (Star 3.3) will invoke automatic conversion of the filing attributes (most noticeably filename). Read the the upgrade restrictions carefully in Restrictions.doc.

4. While it is possible to send mail notes to older systems, one should be very careful about the characters used to compose the message. Messages should generally be restricted to simple character set 0 ascii characters. In particular, no current characters which are in a character set beyond the last OIS character set should be sent. This could cause the older systems to crash.

5. The user dictionary record files for 3.3NR are incompatible with 3.3I or earlier.

6. Fonts and keyboards have been extensively modified to conform to the new character set standard. It is extremely difficult to correctly make all these changes. Be on the lookout for incorrect characters, missing characters (usually noted by black bokes) and character spacing or widths problems. Please help by sending ARs when such inconsistencies are observed.
	
7. Tektronix 4010 Terminal Emulation is not to be delivered until after OS5.0 engineering release. It is listed as part of OS 5.0 because it will not constitute a separate release, but rather will be a loadable config.

8. Absense of the 'q switch when booting used to enable all product factoring switches. Since XDE will be going out to some customers also having Star, the 'q switch is now disabled. Most internal users have been relying on this feature to avoid having to product factor their workstations during development. The time has come for everyone to product factor their workstations. To do this, see your local Star consultant. 3.3N will flash MP code 7505 if your machine is not product factored.

This update is based on Pilot 11.0.

This version of Services is the version with which beta test will be started.


CHANGES

The "Start of System Test" message, which follows this update notice, has been modified to be pertinent to this update.


CHANGES TO SYSTEM TEST CONFIGURATION

The system test configuration is essentially unchanged.  Consult the document Services 8.0 System Test Configuration for the current configuration.


CHANGES TO SOFTWARE

Services is supplying its own microcode with this update.  The microcode has been changed since the twelfth update.  There is on the AlphaServices directory a microcode file that corresponds to the equivalent Pilot microcode file.  These files should be used on all servers using AlphaServices software.

All changes to Services software in this update were in response to the Release Readiness Committee having judged bugs (as represented by ARs) as necessary to be fixed before release.

A change was made to the sorting algorithm for strings in 8.0j.  This is a reminder that to avoid potential failures due to this change, File and Clearinghouse services should be scavenged immediately after installing this version of Services if you are upgrading from a pre-8.0j version.

The following 19 ARs were fixed in this update:

CHS: 9675       
ECS: 11015 
FS:  10816 
Microcode: 10637 10722 10981 11380
MS:  11342 11357
RBS:  9712 10070 10636 10691
SCS:  2094 10172 10958 10987 11045 11184 
  


CHANGES TO DOCUMENTATION

The AlphaServices directory on McKinley was decommissioned.  All Services documentation is now stored in the folder
	[ALT:OSBU North]<AlphaServices>8.0>Doc>

The notes and cautions document was revised to include an additional caution for the File Service and two for the Clearinghouse.  It is stored as

NOTES FOR STAR 4.x USERS

Except as noted in the Release Summary, Services 8.0 is backward compatible with OS 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 releases. 

 
ARs AND PROBLEMS

As usual, please submit all problem reports via the OS Software Adobe (AR) System, specifying "Services" as the system, 8.0q as the version and the hardware configuration on which the trouble occurred.  AFTER submitting the AR, you may contact your favorite Services implementor by phone or message or in person for attention to urgent problems.  (For crashes, if the appropriate person is not available, you should attempt to ascertain the error message that caused the crash, and the call stack before rebooting.)  Here are the appropriate names, by service:

	Clearinghouse Service: Janet <Stucke.pa>
	External Communication Service: Bill <Danielson.pa>
	File Service: Frank <Hanzel.es>
	Diagnostics: Larry <Kluger.pa>
	Gateway Service: Bill <Danielson.pa>
	Interactive Terminal Service: Juan <Porcar.pa>
	Internetwork Routing Service: Larry <Kluger.pa>
	Mail Service: Ted <Wobber.pa>
	Mail Gateway Service: Randy <Gobbel.pa>
	Print Service: John <Beeley.es>
	Remote Batch Service: Doug <Muirhead.pa>
	Server Monitor Service: Larry <Kluger.pa>
	Services Common Software: Saranjit <Saund.es>

Please remember that the AR database is our primary way of keeping track of the many problem reports that we receive during System Test.  We also depend on patterns of problems reported in ARs to develop a global picture of the state of the system and of the progress of System Test.  We cannot keep track of problems reported by word of mouth or by message to random implementors, and therefore we are unable to pay serious attention to problems unless they are documented in ARs.

Ron,

I would like to explain the status of machine translation research of FX and to ask you to technical advice and information on this field.

FX will start machine translation research project from 21 October. Our group is responsible for the research and development of machine translation system.
I recognize the difficulties of the success of the research. But this subject is very challengable for computer science and  contributes to reduce language and culture gap. This leads to make peaces in the world.
At starting point, our project  have 9 researchers( currently 6 ) but will extend 13 researchers till next summer.

Outline of our research plan are the followings:

1) JLISP  enhancement:

JLISP is the basic tool for our research. But we have to enhance the JLISP for establishing more practical research environment. We are very interested in Fontfile, Fontprofile,TEdit,TTYIN,MakeInterpress and CES code/ encoding. Especially. we need TEdit and MakeInterpress  with the capablity of handling Japanese. Therefore, we would like to know Interlisp -D  technical enhancement plan in XC side. This is the great issue for achieving our research goals. Of cource, we  will share to develop  some of enhanced facilities such as MakeInterpress and TEdit(J).
The another interest is  to redesign 1108 based JLISP. The points are D'lion based keyboard assignment and local file systems.
We would like to discuss these issues at Parc.

2)FX joins to MITI'S machine translation project:

FX joins to MITI'S machine translation project which is National project.This project started two years ago. Prof.Nagao of Kyoto University is the leader of the project.  Prof. Nagao's Lab. designs and develops the basic machine translation softwares on Facom M-382 which is IBM compatible mainframe. The  most of  the software is written in UTI-LISP which is one of local LISP languages.
As for joining this project. we have two duties:
One is the development of FX unique machine translation system to utilize the basic softwares of MITI'S project.
Therefore,we try to transfer this UTI-LISP's software to Interlisp-D(JLISP) with automatic conversion and manual tunning. And we will establish the experimental research/development environment for machine translation. I think this is the first step  of our research.
Regarding this conversion, we have to check the  virtual address space of Interlisp-D. We know that Intterlisp-D have 22 bit virtual address space. Do you have any paln to extend virual address space of Interlisp-D?. If you have some one, please let's me know. I hear that Drado can support 8M byte to 32Mbyte  virtual address space in physical level. Can Interlisp-D on Drado support more 8Mbyte virtual address?

The another duty is to send  one reseacher to Prof.Nagao Lab. for the cooperative study/development.

3) Machine aided writting English system:

 I recognize the difficulities of development of the complete automatic machine translation system. and the research is the long-range target. Therefore, we have a strong interest in Machine aided writting English system which is used for professional/knowledge persons. Now we are going  to study the basic system with Keio University.  I think that key technologies are computerlized dictionary and personal information system for managing translator knowleage. Therefore , we are looking for computer-readable dictionaries such as English-Japanese,Japanese-English and English dictionary and find two computer-readable dictionary sources from SANSEIDO(English-Japanese) and KOUDANSYA(Japanese-English). Therefore, we are very interested in your dictionary server. If you have no trouble , please tell us the dictionary server.
 
4)Basic machine translation research:

Mr.Ishikawa-san and Japanese PH.D candidates of Stanford Unversity are very interested in our research. Therefore, we will ask them  the basic machine translation research from viewpoints of Computer Linguistics without disturbing their primary study and the LFG based research at PARC/ISL.  The first research subject of my idea is " Study of objective evaluation method of translated sentences's qualitiy". Do you have any comments to this issue?


Finally, we would like to have a chance of more detailed technical discussion to you and your group. And we will establish to formal technical channel to your group for exchanging information on Interlisp-D(JLISP), the related technology and natural language processing field. Now, we have lack of these information. For exmple, we are using Fugue version, not Carol, because we can not access your public directory.

I am going to visit to your country from 16 Octber for joining UI Forum at Rochester.And with Mr.Ueda we would like to visit you for the above reasons after the Forum . My convenient week is from  22 October to 26 October.
Please reply your schedule.

I am very sorry to interrupt you.
I hope your advice and opinion.

Thank you very much

Noriyuki Kamibayashi

	Here are the messages that (1) held out hope for a larger
address space, (2) point out that we are routinely running out of
address space, and (3) crush our hope for larger address space.
	Could we get a quasi-official statement on if/when we can
hope to see more virtual address space available on the 1108 or 1132?
	Address space is one of the stumbling blocks that prevents us
from even beginning some projects in Interlisp-D.

Subject: Address Space
To: Bill <Yeager@SUMEX-AIM.ARPA>

Here's the story:

Pointers address 16-bit data, so a 24-bit pointer addresses 32MByte.

Current Dolphin hardware can address only 22-bits, and so the maximum
address space on a Dolphin is 8MByte.

Dandelions (1108s) can use up to 32-bit pointers; Dorados (1132s) can
use up to 28-bit pointers. Both of these limits are such that the
limiting factor is the size of the disk area used for backing store
rather than the hardware address space.

I've always been amused by liturature which talks about giga-byte
address spaces on machines with 80 megabyte disks.

	Our LOOPS users have recently been plagued by running out of array
space (typically in BITMAPCREATE).
	I did a (STORAGE T) and found (after failing to allocate a
bitmap) that there were 6740 pages allocated to array space and 172 free.
	I totalled the allocated and free portions of all four data spaces
and found that 10,384 pages had been allocated out of a total of 13,440.
	This seemed consistent with a (VMEMSIZE) of 11,827 pages.
	However, this seems inconsistent with 
(1) the fact that months ago we were told that the dataspace
allocation mechanism would be fixed so that fixed-length datatype
space and array-space would be partitioned dynamically instead of
statically, 
(2) the volume in question has 16,200 pages available in it (not
13,440), and 
(3) the long-standing claim that the dandelion has a much larger
virtual address space than the dolphin.
	What's up?  Does the VMemsize tool have anything to do with this?

Sorry for the delay...

1) In Carol and Harmony, fixed-length datatype space and array-space are
allocated statically. For Harmony, array-space will be better managed so
users will not  get the "Arrays full" error nearly so frequent.

2) There had been 13,440 pages allocated so far, which does not mean
that is the maximum. Array space for example has bounds on how large it
can grow where as the space for CONS cells does not.

3) The virtual address space is 8MB for the 1100, 1108 and 1132.

4) The address space for the Dlion and Dolphin are the same.

The VMemsize tool has nothing to do with this.

To: Nekora, PICSProject^, InterscriptInterest^, Joloboff.osda
Reply-To: Ayers

The previous arrangement of handling the draft Interscript Standard, making it available for review, coordinating edits, not losing things, etc., did not work out.

So here is the new arrangement:

  Basis: Ayers "owns" the draft Interscript Standard.
  
  Reading:
     
     An internally-readable version of the current draft standard will be
     maintained on the NS server McKinley in the drawer <PubliC Ayers> in a 
     folder with a name like <IS Draft Standard 7oct84>. Old versions may 
     be present; use the date to acertain the newest one.
     
  Editing:
     
     If you are a contributor to the Interscript standardization process,
     and wish to edit the draft standard, send a message to Ayers.pa,
     cc'ing Nekora.pa, naming the section to be edited and describing the 
     nature of the change. Assuming the change is appropriate, Ayers will 
     NS-Mail the section to you; you will edit it (in a timely fashion) 
     and NS-Mail it back. Ayers will keep track of 'checked out' sections 
     to avoid editing collisions.

Here is a re-written version, mainly for your use.  The only additions
to the wish list we discussed is microcode support of block structured
arrays --- very important for avoiding paging.   Also, after considering the
matter, I've decided that we really need a working 1108+ to come to a 
final decision.  

Incidently, one of the more important factors will be whether Xerox is
willing to provide serious support for people writing signal
processing code --- without such support, considerations of community,
existing software, etc. pretty much rule out any one using
Interlisp-based products.   You might mention that to the powers that
be.

	INFORMAL COMPARISON OF XEROX 1108 (Dandetigre) LISP MACHINES
	AND SYMBOLICS 3640 LISP MACHINES FOR VISION RESEARCH 
			August 1, 1984
	
	  ***********************************************************
          *     Note: This document is a INITIAL DRAFT, and not to  *
	  *	be quoted or distributed.  A final comparison will  *
	  *	be made after AAAI '84.				    *
	  ***********************************************************

SOURCES OF FIGURES AND ESTIMATES:
	Technical details on 1108 come from unofficial talks
	with L.	Masinter, and have been reviewed him and by J. White. 
	Technical details on Symbolics 3640 come from
	L. Quam, and confirmed by D. Lyon, A. Schiffman.

SCHEDULE FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO 1108
	This report compares machine features as they are expected to
	exist as of Sept 1, 1984.  Because of the rapid pace of 1108 
	development, a reassessment is required after that date to ensure
	planned improvements function as expected.


PERFORMANCE:
	The Weitek chip, together with expanded microcode, will
	make vector, array, FFT and polynomial (incl. sin, cos, etc.)
	floating point operations extremely fast.  
  comparison:
	Symbolics has announced a Weitek-based floating point
	accelerator (FPA), and expanded microstore.  They also expect to 
	support array, polynomial, etc., operations.

	GENERAL FLOATING POINT OPERATIONS: 1108 expects to have 
	within-procedure declarations can be used to avoid 
	boxing-unboxing overhead.  
  comparison:
	If the 1108 declaration	facility can be implemented (1) in a 
	bullet-proof manner, (2) still allowing normal debugging 
	capabilities, (3) allowing declarations of procedure calls to 
	avoid boxing-unboxing, then it will allow most (perhaps 90%)
	of the floating-point functionality available with the
	Symbolics machine.

	OTHER AREAS: overall speed of the 1108 compares to the 3640
	(using available Gabriel benchmarking programs) is typified as follows:
					      		Dandetigre   	Symbolics	
	Takiuchi function (mainly function calls):     	1.67sec		0.59sec
	Boyer theorem prover (mainly symbolic manip.): 119.0sec		19.5sec
	
	Improvement in the 1108's figures is expected due to the expanded 
	microstore.

HARDWAREtured 
	arrays are transparently supported by microcode, this problem 
	could be substantially alleviated.
   comparison:
	Dandetigres have 24 bits of address, compared to Symbolics' 28,
	although the difference is actually more like 10:1 rather than
	16:1, because of the Symbolics larger system.  The available
	of a fast (order 20usec), invisible (automatically done by 
	compiler) memory mapping facility could substantially cure 
	the size limitation.  Somewhat limited real memory size means
	that block structuring of of arrays is probably required in
	order to avoid undue paging.	

	DISKS: Various large disks are being explored for the 1108, and the
	T305 is currently in prototype.  This will be roughly
	equivalent to the Symbolics  Eagle disks.
	
	PORTS: the 1108 has very low latency, very high burst speed
	Ethernet ports, with lower speed sustained transmission rates.  
	The sustained rate is similar to the Symbolics' chaos net.
	The 1108 has several other ports planned, including an RS232
	serial port (56kBaud), and high speed parallel ports.

LANGUAGE and ENVIRONMENT:
	The Xerox environment is expected to have available a
	high-performance objected-oriented programming facility by the
	end of 1984.  The compiler is also expected to integrated
	with the structure editor/debugger, allowing recompilation of 
	individual defuns from within the editor or the debugging
	context.  Limitations on number of atoms, etc. are also
	expected to be removed.	
  comparison:
	Given these improvements the Xerox and Symbolics environments 
	seem at least roughly on par with each other.

DISPLAY:
	Integrated 1108 color display (approx. 512x512 pixels) is in 
	prototype stage.  It may be available by 1/1/85.
  comparison:
	Only significant difference is that the 1108 window system is 
	faster and more convenient than the Symbolics, although less flexible.
	
COMMUNITY AND CONTEXT
	Members of the major AI labs (Stanford, MIT, Carnigie-Mellon,
	SRI) virtually all use DEC or Symbolics equipment, 
	either EMACS or a UNIX editor, andson:

	either EMACS or a UNIX editor, and among lisp users either
	MACLISP, Nil, Franzlisp, or Zetalisp.  
	Additionally, since DEC, Franzlisp, Symbolics and ARPA (by 
	installing Franzlisp and Symbolics machines at evaluation sites) 
	have all committed to Commonlisp, the dominance of
	Commonlisp/EMACS environment seems likely to increase rather 
	than decrease.
	
	Xerox has not decided on compatibility with Commonlisp, or to
	support a EMACS-style editor.  If they do not commit to
	serious support this environment there is a significant 
	barrier to participation of members of the major AI
	labs at sites with Xerox machines.  



			COSTS/BENEFIT TRADEOFFS


SUMMARY
	The 1108 Dandetigre offers a substantially lower cost
alternative to the Symbolics 3640, although with somewhat lower 
performance.  It may therefore provide a more advantageous
cost/benefit ratio, however final judgment must be reserved until after
announcements by Symbolics or other manufacturers at AAAI, and 
after a fully functional 1108 is available for evaluation.

Floating point performance of the 1108 is expected to be approximately
equivalent through use of declarations.  Non-floating point performance
of the 1108 is 1/3 or less that of the Symbolics 3640, a ratio that is
expected to improve somewhat.  The 1108 address space is substantially
more limited (approx. 1/10 the size), a serious problem that is may be
mitigated by using a memory-mapping scheme for large arrays.
Anticipated problems with paging when using the 1108 may be
substantially mitigated by microcode support of block-structured
arrays. Color displays and large disks are expected to be available shortly.

The Interlisp language and environment are expected to be equivalent
to the Symbolics' Zetalisp and environment by removing restrictions (on
array size, number of atoms, etc.) and by introducing high-performance
object-oriented programing and better integration of the compiler with
the editor.  

Compatibility with the vision research community is a very
important factor whose importance has not been fully weighed as of yet.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
The 1108 should be reviewed after the current round of improvements,
to ensure improvements function as expected, and compared to new
products announced at AAAI84.  

It appears that the Xerox 1108 Dandetigre may provide a cost-effective
alternative to the Symbolics 3640 for vision research work,
provided that (1) improvements to the 1108 function as expected, 
(2) Xerox is willing to commit personnel specifically in support of	
efforts to develop signal processing software, and (3) questions 
concerning compatibility with the vision research community can be 
adequately resolved.

smaller than available with Symbolics machine; 
even with dynamic memory-mapping of arrays and
block structuring this could still
cause difficulties for large data sets,
and therefore careful testing on
a working 1108 is required.

Subject: World peace


[ Some of the above addresses are guesses.  If anyone has better
addresses for these people, please forward this.  Also, feel free to
pass this around to others who might be interested. ]

I've been thinking a bit about how best to make peace between the Common
Lisp people, DARPA, the manufacturers who are tied to other Lisps
(Interlisp, Franz, PSL, T, etc.), and the users who still prefer these
other Lisps.  Some of what I have to say probably belongs on the
"subsets" mailing list, but since it's mostly political I thought I'd
send it to this collection of people first.

I think that the smart thing for DARPA to do right now is to support us
in making Common Lisp the best possible environment and to help us with
our standardization efforts, but *NOT* to dictate the choice of Common
Lisp to researchers who prefer some other Lisp.  Heavy-handed tactics
here will be counter-productive.  As the Common Lisp community grows, as
Common Lisp appears on new and exciting machines, and as the Common Lisp
environment improves over time, more and more users will see for
themselves the advantages of making the switch.  But to the greatest
extent possible, we should leave researchers free to choose their own
tools.  AI research is hard enough to do, and if researchers feel they
are being arbitrarily deprived of their favorite tools, their output and
morale will certainly suffer.

People doing AI and AI-like research are often developing prototype
programs, and it would be nice if all of these prototypes were written
in the same language.  This would make it easier for researchers to
study and build upon other researchers' results.  But we must weigh this
convenience against the desires of the researchers themselves.  After
all, a research system will almost always have to be done over before it
is suitable for any heavy use, and the conversion of the system to a
standard language could be done at the time of the rewrite.

Most people overestimate the difficulty of converting an application
program from one Lisp to another.  We at CMU have moved several large
systems from Interlisp to Maclisp and from Franz Lisp to Common Lisp,
and it's really not a big deal.  The only requirement is that you have
some knowledge of both Lisp systems and a list of the differences to
look out for.  With a little bit of DARPA-supported tool-building, this
sort of conversion could be made almost trivial.  Of course, programs
that make extensive use of system facilities (the display, low-level
tense I/O,) are harder, but there are relatively few of these and even
here a bit of tool-building (e.g. a set of fake Interlisp window calls
on the Symbolics machine) would go a long way toward making such
conversions easy.

Of course, some projects will have the goal of delivering running,
usable software, and in such cases DARPA has a legitimate need to
specify the language in which this software is to run.  For AI software,
that language will probably be Common Lisp.  Let me suggest that in such
cases DARPA should require that the delivered software RUN IN
a vanilla Common Lisp implementation.  No offical "compromise subset" is
needed.  People who develop their code in Common Lisp can use the full
language; people who prefer to work in Interlisp or PSL can simply avoid
using such troublesome features as lexical closures or multiple values.
We could easily develop a short list of "style suggestions" for people
trying to straddle the fence and a simple mechanical post-processor to
do whatever low-level syntactic conversion is needed.  The
post-processor might also flag any code that will not run in Common
Lisp and that cannot be mechanically converted.

The point is not to make the translation of arbitrary programs fully
automatic -- that's too hard to do in general -- but just to provide a
reasonable option for people who prefer to work in some other Lisp but
who must occasionally deliver a chunk of Common Lisp software to DARPA
or some other contractor.  Such people are still at some disadvantage as
compared to users of native Common Lisp -- they cannot use the full
richness of the language -- but I see no reason to force everyone to use
a subset just because some people are straddling a fence, or to force
the PSL people to use the same Common Lisp subset as the Interlisp
people.  As long as the researchers can use whatever system they like
and ALL the delivered code runs adequately in Common Lisp, everyone
should be happy.

Finally, there is the question of whether DARPA should continue to pay
for the purchase of machines that do not run (or plan to run) Common
Lisp when (a) DARPA belives that Common Lisp will be an almost-universal
standard sometime in the future, (b) DARPA wants to see such a standard
emerge, and (c) DARPA plans to require certain kinds of software to be
delivered in Common Lisp sometime in the future.  I think that the
question really is who is best qualified to make such a decision, the
researcher or the sponsor.  DARPA should certainly advise contractors of
its beliefs and preferences about the future of Lisp, but if an
established research organization finds such arguments unconvincing, I
think that a wise sponsor would yield to the wisdom of the people down
in the trenches.  They are the ones who have to live with the decision,
after all.

This whole problem would go away, of course, if SOMEONE were to do a
good Common Lisp implementation for the Dandelion.  As far as I know, it
is the only machine currently of interest to the AI research community
for which no Common Lisp is planned.  I think that DARPA, Xerox, and the
existing Dandelion user community would all benefit from this move,
regardless of how many users actually switch from Interlisp to this
version of Common Lisp.  Having such an implmentation available would
decouple the choice of machine from the choice of language.  As soon as
there is a firm commitment to produce a Dandelion Common Lisp, people
can buy Dandelions secure in the knowledge that if they ever want to
move to Common Lisp they can do so without having to buy new hardware.
At that point, they are free to continue using Interlisp as long as they
feel it is better, without taking the risk of being left behind.  At
present, many people who like Interlisp are afraid to buy Dandelions
because they are afraid that they MIGHT be trapped in in a stagnant pool
far from the mainstream.

Xerox would not have to provide that Common Lisp implementation itself,
but would have to cooperate a bit to make it happen.  With Xerox's
cooperation, it would only take a man-year or two.  DARPA might help to
fund such an implementation, in the interest of protecting several
million dollars worth of hardware owned by its contractors, or someone
like Lucid might do it as a purely commercial venture.  With the
recently-announced hardware extensions, I think that a Dandelion could
run Common Lip rather well.

Well, those are my own views, as of today.  Let's try to keep the
communication lines open.  If we all try to work for the common good and
to keep the other person's problems in mind, I think that we can solve
these problems with minimal pain all around.  If a silly religious war
breaks out, everyone loses.

Subject: Re: small objects in Cedar
To: CedarFolklore^, DragonCore^, hagmann
cc: Deutsch, Purcell, Nuyens

Interlisp attempts to improve the working set of list cells in particular by two mechanisms:

a) the free list is threaded thru the page. Each page has a firstcell and a nextpage field. (FirstCell is 8 bits, NextPage is 16 bits). This way, sequential CONSes tend to get allocated on the same page, even if (b) doesn't help:

b) when doing a CONS, it tries to put the cell on the same page as thing being CONSed. This is true both for lists built right to left using CONS, and those build left to right (there is a primitive RPLCONS that does X:next _ cons[new, x:next] that attempts to put the CONS on the same page as X).

We use this only for list cells, and not for other small objects, but folks tend to build things either out of lists or else out of data structures that are much larger.

Given these heuristics, it isn't so important that the pages be tiny.

===================
About Cedar and lists:
Russ Atkinson and some of the lisp group have been talking about Lisp on the Dragon. I had the design goal of of allowing Lisp and Cedar to be freely intermix. One could think of translating a Lisp function into a Cedar procedure where every variable is declared REF ANY. However, this would be pretty slow for a couple of the time-critical operations in Lisp, including list manipulation. We're iterating on a design that would handle 4 distinct cases: lists, integers, floating numbers, and other (Cedar-type) refs. A LispRef is a 32-bit quantity, indicated by the high order bits:
100*	List pointer (2^29)

1111* immediate (28-bit) negative integers
0000* immediate (28-bit) positive integer

011* Cedar Ref (2^29)

Some of the tags in the 10* range and 01* range are used for immediate IEEE floating point numbers. (I can't find my the note on the bit pattern assignments for the floats) This encoding means that you can do all arithmetic in "generic" mode allowing arbitrary precision or rationals but only paying for them when you need them. Lists are handled special because they don't have the overhead/cell. Russ suggests using a separate 8-bit list cell reference count table to hold the reference counts for list cells. It complicates the GC and reference count mechanism slightly to handle lists specially, but not too much.

		***Tektronix 4010 Terminal Emulation (to be delivered after Star 3.3 Engineering Release)

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Klamath
Star 3.3OR requires the Klamath System Software release.

Display Font Files
All display font files now have the extension '.StarFont' applied to the data file names. See the installation document for details.

STAR Documents
Star document version compatibility is consistent with major release standards. Star Documents from OS 4.0 (Star 3.0), OS4.1 (Star 3.1), OS 4.2 (Star 3.2), Star 3.2IRKlamath (StarK), and 3.2irVTb (VT100 pre-release) are automatically converted to OS 5.0 (Star 3.3) when the documents are opened on an OS 5.0 desktop or Upgraded to OS5 via the desktop menu command. Star documents from releases prior to OS 4.0 should be upgraded to one of the above mentioned versions before adopting Star 3.3OR. OS 5.0 Star documents are not recognized by any earlier version of Star. Documents created in earlier versions of Star 3.3 which contain fields or tables need to be paginated (not simple paginate) before using.
	
STAR Record Files
Record files from all previous versions will be converted to Star 3.3 format when they are first opened. Star 3.3 record files will not be usable on any earlier version. There are no known problems in converting old record files to Star 3.3. However, for the duration of System Test we recommend copying your old record files before first opening them in Star 3.3. If the converted record file opens correctly, and you can Show View Properties on each view, then the original may be deleted. If the Open or Show View Properties fails, then the original unconverted record file should be referenced as the Test Case in an AR.

STAR Spreadsheets
Spreadsheets from 3.1 and 3.2 have the same format in Star 3.3.

STAR Floppy Disks
Star 3.2 floppy disks are readable on Star 3.3. The data objects transferred from the floppy to the desktop will still adhere to the compatibility restrictions listed above. Star 3.2 and earlier versions will not read Star 3.3 floppy disks.

STAR Desktops
The combination of converting to Klamath, Filing, Clearinghouse, new document format, new character set standard, and expanding the Star system volume size causes desktop compatibility to be somewhat less than straightforward. Details on retaining desktop data are contained in the Installation.doc referenced below. 

Compatibilty with Basic Workstation
Basic Workstation 2.0 is compatible with Star 3.3OR with respect to Services facilities. Basic Workstation 2.0 and Star 3.3OR can share the same user volume.

Compatibility with Services 8.0
Star 3.3OR can communicate only with services using Services 8.0 software (OS 5.0). Servers running Services 7.0 are now quite rare within OSD.



RESTRICTIONS
===========
Please read the detailed restrictions in:
 
	[Rain|Ibis]<AlphaStar>3.3OR>Doc>Restrictions.doc  --3 pages.

General restrictions are:

1. Star 3.3 will require about 1500 more disk pages for system usage than Star 3.2. Necessary architectural extensions provided in the Klamath System Software release resulted in approximately a 500 page growth in the stored bootfile. Conversion to the latest Xerox Character Set Standard resulted in a 500 page growth in the display fonts file. New feature added to Star 3.3 has resulted, thus far, in a 500 page growth in the bootfile. Physical volume repartitioning will be required for most users. Details are in the Installation.doc referenced below.

Suggested minimum system volume sizes as a function of disk size:

10MB: 6700 pages
29MB: 8000 pages
42MB: 9000 pages

These numbers are for customer configurations only and are computed assuming that the whole disk being devoted to Star. Only users upgrading from OS4.x to OS5.0 need repartition their disk.

2. This is not a restriction but is listed here to get your attention. The display font files (*.StarFont) need to be loaded in a specific order so that overriding of characters common to multiple display files will be accomplished as advertised. This happens automatically for our customers in the floppy installation process. Those of us who load with the StarFile tool or other means must load the the display fonts in the following order - AStar followed by JStar followed by CStar.

3. Pre-OS 5.0 desktops stored on an OS 5.0 file service and fetched to an OS 5.0 Star (Star 3.3) will invoke automatic conversion of the filing attributes (most noticeably filename). Read the the upgrade restrictions carefully in Restrictions.doc.

4. While it is possible to send mail notes to older systems, one should be very careful about the characters used to compose the message. Messages should generally be restricted to simple character set 0 ascii characters. In particular, no current characters which are in a character set beyond the last OIS character set should be sent. This could cause the older systems to crash.

5. The user dictionary record files for 3.3OR are incompatible with 3.3I or earlier.

6. Fonts and keyboards have been extensively modified to conform to the new character set standard. It is extremely difficult to correctly make all these changes. Be on the lookout for incorrect characters, missing characters (usually noted by black bokes) and character spacing or widths problems. Please help by sending ARs when such inconsistencies are observed.
	
7. Tektronix 4010 Terminal Emulation is not to be delivered until after OS5.0 engineering release. It is listed as part of OS 5.0 because it will not constitute a separate release, but rather will be a loadable config.

8. Absense of the 'q switch when booting used to enable all product factoring switches. Since XDE will be going out to some customers also having Star, the 'q switch is now disabled. Most internal users have been relying on this feature to avoid having to product factor their workstations during development. The time has come for everyone to product factor their workstations. To do this, see your local Star consultant. 3.3N will flash MP code 7505 if your machine is not product factored.

Since many of you have not seen this before, here is our current Vaxc policy:

Security:

It is the user's responsibility to protect any information (processed and/or stored) under their directory which is derived from classified or proprietary company information or should so be treated under corporate policy. Users must understand the Unix protection features available for this purpose if they are dealing with such information. Users must also protect their directories from unauthorized disclosure or use and keep their password in strict confidence.

Account policy:

PARC-Vaxc is administered by a committee comprised of representatives from CSL, SCL, ISL, and OSD (VaxcCommittee^.pa).  Vaxc accounts are available for Xerox employees or consultants who have a work-related need for one, and whose use will conform to the following guidelines:

1)  The VAX was primarily intended as Xerox's interface to the Arpanet for Telnet and FTP use, and secondarily for specific projects within OSD and ICL. Other uses are allowed only insofar as they do not interfere or add a noticable load. The VAX is not a general time sharing facility. Use of EMACS, VI, or other editors on the VAX is strongly discouraged, as is use of TEX. Users of the VAX for computation should edit on their local workstation and download files to the VAX via FTP.

2)  No backup of user files should ever be expected. Keep files on your local workstation and on your IFS. Exceptions (e.g., files that you would like to leave for Arpanet users and have backed up) can be made.

3)  Currently, disk allocations are not being enforced. This is subject to change at short notice, if disk space becomes a problem. In general, users agree to keep disk usage to an absolute minimum.

4)  Compute bound jobs are to be run with low priority ("niced"). 

5)  Users, by accepting an account on the vaxc, agree to abide by the above rules. Those who don't are subject to having their account priviledges taken away.

Better User.cm and exec argument processing has been added to [Igor]<Hacks>11.1>Tools>NSChat.bcd. This will not run on Mesa 11.0, and any requesting that I convert it will be shot.

Bryan

From the documentation:

-- NSChat.doc

NSChat allows you to chat to NS Remote System Administration, ITS and to NS Remote Executive. Type to the Executive:

  NSChat <host>/<switch> 

  where the switches are as follows:
  
    s	NS Remote System Administration
    i	ITS
    e	NS Remote Executive
    
A NSChat window will appear.  If you have the LogIn boolean selected, you will be logged in automatically.

Options: 
  In the Options sheet you can select which type of service you want to talk to. Open the options sheet and select the desired host type (sa, exec, or its). Then hit Apply! on the option sheet. 

Connecting: 
  Type the name of the host into the textsw of NSChat and hit the DOIT key (the one labeled MARGINS on the Dandelion keyboard).  You should then be connected to the remote host.  

NSChat has almost the exact user interface as that of the released Chat program. All the commands on the tools form subwindow behave analogous as those of Chat.

User.cm:
NSChat will read the following User.cm entries:

[NSChat]
LogIn: TRUE FALSE
HostType: sa any exec its

From the documentation:

-- NSRemoteExec.doc
-- Yamamoto	16-Nov-84 13:28:00

NSRemoteExec allows you to make your workstation available for other people to user via NSChat.  After running NSRemoteExec, you get the following commands:

  NSRemoteExec.~ <arg>
    <arg> is either "on" or "off", ie NSRemoteExec.~ on.
    If there is no argument, this command will tell you whether the NSRemoteExec is on or off.

  Quit.~  is invoked by the remote user to disconnect.

  ListNSRemoteHosts.~ gives a listing of all currently connected users.
  
  ShowAccessList.~ shows the list of groups that can connect to your machine

User.cm entries look as follows:

[System]
NSAccessList: <list>

where <list> is a list of users or groups. If there are spaces in a name, the name must be quoted. Examples:

  NSAccessList: "SDD-Mesa:OSBU North:Xerox"  Yamamoto Marzullo Davirro

If the domain and organization are left out, the defaults are used from the Profile tool. Note: The access list is processed right to left, so it better to put the largest groups on the left hand side and the single users on the right hand side for better efficiency.  

To connect to a machine (my machine is called Yamamoto) running NSRemoteExec via NSChat, you would type into the Executive:

  NSChat Yamamoto/e

Reply-To: JLarson.pa

In case you didn't know, Xerox PARC is now an Arpanet member of CSNET.  

From CSNET introductory literature:

"CSNET is an international network of Computer Science researchers in industry, government and universities.  Currently underwritten by a $5 million grant from the National Science Foundation, CSNET is a logical network which uses the physical facilities of the public data network Telenet, the DOD-sponsored Arpanet and a telephone-based message relay system called PhoneNet.  The goal of CSNET is to facilitate the exchange of ideas and to enhance collaborative efforts among computer scientists."

"DARPA is making use of CSNET available to Arpanet users on an experimental basis to foster increased interaction among the CSNET and Arpanet research community."

"CSNET provides its users with: 

	* electronic mail service to nearly 100 member  
          organizations in the United States and Canada  

	* gateways to other networks in the United States,  
          Canada, and Europe for the exchange of mail and files   

	* a database of CSNET users, indexed by keyword, for       
          locating network addresses and groups of users with       
	  common interests                                           

	* access to national network mailing lists in areas of        
	  special interest to computer scientists and engineers:       
	  operating systems, microcomputers, programming                
	  languages, computer graphics, and more"                        


Sending Mail to a CSNET site from Xerox:

The proper syntax is:  user%site.csnet@CSNET-Relay

Please avoid commercial use of CSNET which might put stress on the current Arpanet/CSNET relationship.

Subject: Fourteenth Update of Services 8.0 System Test
From: The Services Implementors <Ladner.pa>
To: ServicesSystemTest^.es
Reply-to: Ladner.pa

This message announces the fourteenth update (version 8.0r) to Services 8.0 System Test.  It lists the changes made to the software and documentation since the thirteenth update of system test, and includes a current version of the original release message.

This update is based on Pilot 11.0.

This is the last update of the Services 8.0 system test.

CHANGES

The "Start of System Test" message, which follows this update notice, has been modified to be pertinent to this update.


CHANGES TO SYSTEM TEST CONFIGURATION

The system test configuration has been decommissioned.


CHANGES TO SOFTWARE

All changes to Services software in this update were made at the request of the Release Readiness Committee.

A change was made to the sorting algorithm for strings in 8.0j.  This is a reminder that to avoid potential failures due to this change, File and Clearinghouse services should be scavenged immediately after installing this version of Services if you are upgrading from a pre-8.0j version.

The following 13 ARs were fixed in this update:

CHS: 11595 11723       
ECS: 11243 11334 11752 
FS:  11781  
IRS: 11433
PS:  9033 11609 
SCS: 11383 11497 11730 11824  
  


CHANGES TO DOCUMENTATION

The AlphaServices directory on McKinley was decommissioned.  All Services documentation is now stored in the folder
	[ALT:OSBU North]<AlphaServices>8.0>Doc>

The notes and cautions document was revised to include three additional cautions for the File Service, one for the RS-232C diagnostic, one for the Print Service, and one for the Clearinghouse.  It is stored as
	[ALT:OSBU North]<AlphaServices>8.0>Doc>Services 8.0 Notes & Cautions
	[ALT:OSBU North]<AlphaServices>8.0>Doc>Services 8.0 Notes & Cautions
			(Interpress)

The Print Service functional specification has had two new sections added: the product description for Interpress masters handled, and one for support of telecopiers.  They are stored as
	[ALT:OSBU North]<AlphaServices>8.0>Doc>Services 8.0 ESCNs>
		Print Service 8.0 FS>
			Interpress Product Description
and
			Telecopier Phone Number Support

There are corresponding Interpress masters stored in the folder:

SCHEDULE AND INFORMATION

This is the last update and will be the release version of Services 8.0.
	
Information for Services 8.0 system testers is disseminated through the distribution list ServicesSystemTest^.es.  If you know of anyone who should be on this list and who is not, please send a message to Owners-ServicesSystemTest^.es.


AVAILABLE SERVICES

Most of the Services AlphaTest network has been decommissioned.  If some service is needed for testing, you should contact Debbie <Menzies.es> who acts as System Adminstrator for the El Segundo services, or Jennifer Douglas <JDouglas.pa> who acts as System Administrator for the Palo Alto services.       

	
NOTES FOR STAR 4.x USERS

Except as noted in the Release Summary, Services 8.0 is backward compatible with OS 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 releases. 

 
ARs AND PROBLEMS

As usual, please submit all problem reports via the OS Software Adobe (AR) System, specifying "Services" as the system, 8.0r as the version and the hardware configuration on which the trouble occurred.  AFTER submitting the AR, you may contact your favorite Services implementor by phone or message or in person for attention to urgent problems.  (For crashes, if the appropriate person is not available, you should attempt to ascertain the error message that caused the crash, and the call stack before rebooting.)  Here are the appropriate names, by service:

	Clearinghouse Service: Janet <Stucke.pa>
	External Communication Service: Bill <Danielson.pa>
	File Service: Frank <Hanzel.es>
	Diagnostics: Larry <Kluger.pa>
	Gateway Service: Bill <Danielson.pa>
	Interactive Terminal Service: Juan <Porcar.pa>
	Internetwork Routing Service: Larry <Kluger.pa>
	Mail Service: Ted <Wobber.pa>
	Mail Gateway Service: Randy <Gobbel.pa>
	Print Service: John <Beeley.es>
	Remote Batch Service: Doug <Muirhead.pa>
	Server Monitor Service: Larry <Kluger.pa>
	Services Common Software: Peter <Alfvin.es>

Please remember that the AR database is our primary way of keeping track of the many problem reports that we receive during System Test.  We also depend on patterns of problems reported in ARs to develop a global picture of the state of the system and of the progress of System Test.  We cannot keep track of problems reported by word of mouth or by message to random implementors, and therefore we are unable to pay serious attention to problems unless they are documented in ARs.

Thanks for taking the time to generate these figures and send us the results. We've done some further analysis as well. Your statement "it seems that PUP outperforms the both implementations of NS without any dispute" doesn't quite match the data: NS2 outperforms PUP for tests 1 (INFILEP), 6 (SYSOUT), 7 (SYSIN) and 8 (directory) .  Your last chart included NS2/NS1 and PUP/NS1, but omitted the critical one, namely PUP/NS2.

While we're pleased with the performance improvements in Harmony, we hope to get much better performance in the future.  I'm not willing to admit such a perjorative categorization as "extreamly lousy" -- but there certainly is room for a number of (planned) improvements. For example, talking to a server requires opening a connection. In a timing test involving 10 repetitions, the PUP code will usually reuse the connection established in the first call for subsequent calls; the NS code currently opens and closes a new connection for each call. 

There are some additional methodological problems with the "small" benchmarks: there is a high variance in the network server responsiveness, network load, and what all. (Keep in mind that the PARC net has a fairly high load than you will find at Syntelligence.) The servers themselves may keep some cache of recently used files beyond the control of Lisp; 10 INFILEPs in a row on the same file name may be much faster than 10 INFILEP's for completely different files.   

Both TIME and TIMEALL measure elapsed time. TIMEALL also gives a better breakdown of storage allocations, but it isn't too significant.

XEROX AWARDS GRANTS FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT

Thirteen universities in the United States and England have been awarded computer system grants by Xerox worth $12.5 million.  The grants provide each school with the Xerox Development Environment, an advanced software and hardware development system used extensively at Xerox since 1978.

Computer scientists and others will use this equipment mainly for research and teaching in the areas of distributed computing applications, programming languages, network architectures, and software development tools and environments.  Other groups will use the equipment for research in medicine, management, artificial intelligence and office automation.

Schools were selected after an extensive review based on submitted proposals for research and teaching.  The schools are Brown University, California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, University of California at Berkeley, Cambridge University, Cornell University, University of Maryland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Princeton University, University of Rochester, Stanford University, University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

The company said the program is unique because it grants the universities complete computer systems that support distributed computing applications, including collaborative research among the schools.  It is the first large-scale university grant the company has made in the field of computer programming systems and networks.

"By providing these schools with the Xerox Development Environment and its underlying programming technologies, Xerox hopes to advance the schools' research and teaching capabilities," said R.V. Adams, president, Xerox Systems Group.  "We are excited about the research the schools have proposed and look forward to working with them.

Not sure I want to write all the prose, but here are things that occur to me as I look at that summary:

1.  "PUP outperforms the both implementations of NS without any dispute, except when it comes to retrieve sysouts." -- his figures actually say that NS2 (Harmony) outperforms Pup for tests 1, 6, 7 and 8 (INFILEP, SYSOUT, SYSIN, DIRECTORY).

2.  Were the servers all on the directly connected net, or did you have to go thru gateways to get to some of them?

3.  Timings for the small operations are almost meaningless, since there is a high variance in network server responsiveness, net load, etc.  Gathering timings for many repetitions helps somewhat, but this leads to point 4...

4.  Fallacy in using repetition count for these operations.  In at least some cases, the hard work is done on the first call and the subsequent calls may be much faster because of various sorts of caching.  For example, the Pup code will usually reuse the BSP connection already established for the first call, while the NS code currently opens and closes a new connection for each call.  Less obviously, the server may also be performing some caching beyond the control of Lisp, so that 10 INFILEP's in a row on the same file name is much faster than 10 INFILEP's for completely different files.  Thus, the timing for 10 repetitions is not an accurate reflection of how long one such operation typically takes in isolation.  Try the same test with repetitions occurring 5 minutes apart, and you might get different figures.

Of course, to the extent that file operations often are NOT done in isolation, but grouped together (INFILEP often immediately precedes OPENFILE, for example), it can be important that the implementation take advantage of caching.  However, the tests as run suggest far too much bias in that direction.

5.  "Will the client code on the Dandelion be revised for even better performance...?"  -- Almost certainly.  The NS Filing implementation is still "young" from Lisp's point of view, and there are a number of ways to improve it.  In particular, the Lisp Filing client code has not been rewritten to take advantage of all the new functionality in Services 8.0, some of which should substantially improve the performance of INFILEP, OPENFILE and DELFILE.

6.  OUTFILEP works in Harmony.

7.  In the relative speed table, why not Pup/NS2?  It has been demonstrated that Harmony NS is substantially improved over Carol.  I would not, however, expect much difference between Carol and Harmony Pup, since little was done to the Pup code in that period.

8.  Don't know of any reason intrinsically why COPYFILE of a modest size file should be much worse relatively than SYSOUT for NS.  I suspect at least in part it is a reflection of the bug described in (2) above, which penalizes the NS code for extra connection overhead.  I'd be interested in seeing that in closer detail.

Subject: Customer Support Activities
To: Sannella.pa

Michael,

Judy Dering debriefed me on the procedings of last Monday's Lisp meeting in Palo Alto.  She seems to have caught the brunt of some negative sentiment sparked by my message to you on 25 Oct 84 18:36, in which I described our Harmony release policy.  She also reported a request for clarification on the nature of Customer Support activities.  I'd like to respond to that request, and in so doing enlighten you on the rationale for our release policy.

I.  Day to day activites

1.  We support the current Customer Release of Interlisp-D.  We spend most of our time helping old and new customers use Carol productively.  This is a labor-intensive activity.  Each of the four Software Support staff carries 33 customers on his/her back.  To do this job effectively consumes more manhours than we have available.  We focus most of our attention on Carol. While Development is preoccupied with Harmony and the night and day  struggle to make Intermezzo a reality, all of our concentration is on Carol-related customer issues.  Software that has long escaped your attention has captivated ours.  We interact all day with customers by phone, over the net, and with personal site visits.  The subject of this interaction is Carol: getting it installed, reporting bugs, resolving communication problems (RS232, DEI, FTPServer), getting LOOPS, KEE, ROSIE, et al updated, etc..  

2.  We fly to new customer sites and give a day's worth of personal attention to people unfamiliar with our product. This practice helps almost all of our naive users over the initial shock of our installation procedures and quickly exposes them to the power and beauty of a running Interlisp-D environment.  When we have failed to provide this service for novice users, the results have been disasterous. 

3.  We interact with BSG.  This takes the form of endless interactions with customers and BSG service people who can't really cope with a malfunctioning Dandelion running Interlisp.  In some parts of the country, BSG is effective in solving our customers' hardware problems.  In other parts, the situation is bad.   We're working on getting it better. 

4.  We  interact with OSD/SDD.  This happens  almost everytime a customer with an 1108 interacting with Services software runs into trouble: missing fonts on the print server, inexplicable MP codes or unintelligible diagnostics from a fileserver.  The handful of sites running NS print and file servers require special attention disproportionate to their number.

5.  We support marketing.  This means trips to potential customer sites, or 2 day presentations at trade shows, backing up Dennis Dunn's group.  Typically, one or more us is on the road during the week.  This is currently THE highest priority activity. 

6.  We support the University Grants Program.  A relatively small percentage of our time is spent coordinating field support with XDE representatives and opening lines of communication with Interlisp-D sites.

7.  One of us attends the weekly Lisp meeting in Palo Alto.  This is where we learn about work-in-progress, about the condition of software in Alpha test, and software, such as Intermezzo, undergoing active development.  

8.  Problem verification.  We process raw, sometimes bitter customer problem reports into  a more palatable form for inspection by the software development group in Palo Alto.  We reproduce the bugs whenever possible, a practice that can consume hours.

These eight activities require more manpower than is currently available.  Priorities are established by Gary, Dennis, Marcel and me;  we respond by shifting our attention from one activity to another.  


Which brings me to the software release process.

II. Software Release

When a new  release sysout leaves the Alpha state, the above-mentioned activities come to a virtual standstill and we direct our energies towards preparing a release to customers.  For Harmony, these time-loaded activities are as follows: 

1.  Customer-oriented documentation. [130 hrs]
2.  Software test (sysout and Library packages) [280 hrs]
3.  Beta site software support [140 hrs]
4.  Assembling the prototype customer software kit. [24 hrs]

Here, too, priorities are flexible: should Gary or Dennis decide that technical support for a trade show is sufficiently important, Release manhours are redirected to Marketing support.  Should a "priority" customer, such as MCC, stridently demand an on-site visit to resolve product problems, we will divert someone from Release tasks to attend to the matter.

Software release has a traumatic effect on our day-to-day operations.  I do not blithely commit to the release process until I am sure software under development in Palo Alto has really left the Alpha state.  This is a tough call to make. I look at the frequency and seriousness of bugs reported by internal users.  Usually, I wait for the frequency of new loadups to diminish to some reasonably small number (less than one per week).  This tells me that the development group has a stable, reliable sysout ready for testing.  By no means do I anticipate a bug-free sysout.  But I do rely on one which has been "blessed" by  the developers; i.e.,  most of the core software plus new features seem to be working.  

We test those aspects of the system which usually are not exercised very much by the development group.  This includes DLion file system, floppy support, RS232 Chat and file transfer, serial printers, Tedit, NS filing and printing, DEI interaction, etc.  We test the library packages to as great an extent as possible.  We verify that ARs declared fixed are really fixed. 



III.  Release policy

I got from my discussion with Judy Dering that some members of the Development group were chagrined with aspects of my message describing Release policy: a) my request for formal notification that software has left the Alpha state; b) my refusal to support Alpha software running at customer sites; c) my reluctance to begin serious testing of Alpha software in Pasadena.  I would have prefered to hear these criticisms firsthand, rather than responding to Judy's interpretation of them.  In the meantime, I offer the following elaborations:

a)  Formal notification of a new software release.  I need to know when the development phase is complete.  This means  the developers  have asserted their software is working, active development has ceased, and the software is ready for Beta test.  Heretofore, I have relied on a few indicators, such as frequency of new loadups, or announcements to internal users, to decide when to commence Beta test.  I prefer the handoff from Development to Operations to be clean: a message telling me where to find the software and release documentation.  Once this release message is accepted by me, we copy the sysout, library and user packages to Pasadena and freeze the directories. 

b)  As a courtesy to Software Development, I am willing to distribute  Alpha software to designated customer sites.  I am extremely reluctant to ask the Software Support staff to interact with customers running software under development.   This has been my policy for the Chorus, Fugue, and Carol releases as well, and should come as no surprise.  There is substantial day-to-day stress in dealing with current product  (Carol) related issues.  It is unfair of me to expect that the development team is aware of -- or sympathetic to -- the magnitude of this stress.   However, I am reluctant to compound it with issues relating to software under development.  The analogy is requring an automobile dealership's Service Department to be responsive to the problems test drivers are having with cars fresh off the drawing board, undergoing further development, for which no complete service manual is available.  

c)  This issue seems to be the most volatile.  The question asked by Software Development seems to be: why haven't you been actively testing Harmony?  I sense disappointed expectations, as though Software Support has not been doing its fair share to bring Harmony to fruition.  The answer, perhaps unsatisfying, is this: there is no software test group in Pasadena.  There are four product support people tending to Carol fulltime.  When software is released from Palo Alto, we shift gears, reassign priorities, and spend about 600 hours preparing the customer release.  This number is nowhere near the amount of effort Development has already invested in Harmony, and I can see the basis for the feeling that we're not pulling our weight.  We do, however, compensate for that perceived inadequacy by taking upon ourselves the grueling,  longterm  task of supporting the thing when it reaches our customers.  


V. Release process

Approximately two weeks before I formally commit to commence Beta test in Pasadena, I work with Clay and Marcel in assembling a test facility: essentially a room with three or four registered DLions, a Dolphin,  access to print and file servers and assorted RS232 paraphenalia.  This equipment is scrounged from diverse sources with strong promises to return it after testing is complete.  (When capital equipment is permanently allocated for the testing lab, this ritual will cease).

When the Palo Alto Release Master announces software has completed the devlopment cycle -- and I concur -- the Lisp sysout, Library packages, and documentation are moved to a fileserver in Pasadena and frozen.  The sysout is considered to be a candidate for release to customers.

At this point, I commit to intensive Beta test and begin distributing the software and rough documentation to designated  Beta customer sites.  The goal is to find as many bugs as quickly as possible and categorize them as "unimportant" or "showstoppers".  We feed bug reports back to the development team as problems are discovered.  Then we await the arrival of software which fixes the "showstoppers".  In the past, only one or two sysouts were required to fix all the major problems with the original sysout.  With the arrival of each sysout, we begin testing from scratch.   

In parallel with this activity, release documentation is edited and prepared for  review by the development team.

During the Release process, customer support activity is minimal, site visits to new customers are curtailed,  and marketing support suffers lower priority.  In general, the Interlisp-D user community pays the price.  What saves the day is our promise that a new, more potent release of Interlisp is underway.

When we declare the Beta test cycle complete, Software Support attends to the pile of defered tasks that had been building up during the weeks of testing and release.  No further testing responsibilities are assigned until the next version of Interlisp has completed development.

I do not claim this is the best way to test and release software.  Given the current staffing levels, and the Herculean effort required to get the release out the door, it has proven realistic and effective.   


VI.  Future plans


We plan to staff a software test/QA group with ongoing checkout responsibilities.  With the formation of this group, and a well-defined interface to the Development team, we would be able to coordinate testing and development much more effectively without impairing our ability to support our customers.  

Jim Wogulis has been serving approximately in that capacity since he returned from his apprenticeship in Palo Alto.  He has been testing Harmony sysouts over the past few weeks.  He has worked primarily with the DLion file system, file and print servers and provided feedback to Development.  As we hire more systems-oriented people, we can be more effective in responding to requests to test and support Alpha level software.

As we discussed at the last Network Standards Committee meeting on November 14 in El Segundo, IEEE 802.3 compatibility is a serious issue.  In order to be compatible (or inter-operable) with the IEEE 802.3 Standard, it is necessary that no Xerox product employ Ethernet packets with a type number of less than hex 0600h.  

It has been observed that several Divisions (including Versatec/EIS and ED/SIS) employ PUPs (with type number - hex 200) in their products.  In addition, Research is using PUPs to communicate with Xerox products on the 10 Mbps pro,,,,

Dick,

Last Friday, Gary requested that we put together some material for a field letter on the subject of the disks and virtual memories required for Interlisp vis-a-via the competition.  I have drafted out an initial version of that in what follows.  Could you please polish it up, fill in the details and work with Dennis or whoever he nominates, on getting it sent out to the field sales reps?  December 5?

- Beau

 - DRAFT -

The large virtual memory and the large disks that are standard equipment on Symbolics and other competitive machines are often presented by their sales reps as a feature which indicates a decisive superiority of their product over the Interlisp systems.  For example, the Symbolics memory image (the equivalent of our sysout) is released at about 25 MB and typically lives on a rigid disk of between 170-470 MB.  By comparison the Interlisp-D system is released with a memory image of about 2.5 MB and resides on a disk whose capacity is either 40 or 80 MB.  A straightforward comparison of these numbers would suggest that the Symbolics software offers ten times the functionality and that the virtual memory system offers 10 times the space for expansion.  This is a totally invalid conclusion.
To begin with the functionality issue, both systems are roughly the same size, on the order 10-15 MB of source code.  Furthermore, anyone who has done a feature for feature comparison of the two software systems quickly comes to the conclusion that they are very closely matched.  Almost any feature found in one environment is found in some form in the other.  The environments certainly differ radically in their programming and design styles, but they are very comparable in terms of the range of functionality, although specific areas in one system are often much more highly developed than the corresponding area in the other.
The reason that these comparable source systems turn into such radically different amounts of compiled code and virtual memory image is that the Interlisp system places a tremendous premium on compact representation, both of the compiled code and also of data structures.  Thus, Interlisp-D compiles into an 8 bit byte code which uses implicit, i.e., stack based addressing.  This is a much more compact representation than the 12 (Dick - please check this with Larry) bit op codes used by the 3600.  Furthermore, although no detailed space benchmarks have been done to contrast the amount of compiled code needed to represent the same function in the two systems, we believe that the Interlisp code representation is significantly more compact than that of Symbolics.  When we moved Interlisp from the PDP-10, this code representation compacted the size of the compiled code by factors of 2 to 4!  Likewise, we have paid a great deal of attention to compactly representing data structures such as cons cells in very compact encodings.
In addition, precisely because our virtual memories and our disk sizes have been smaller, we have paid a greater attention toward managing the address space that was used (Dick - Larry may be able to provide you with some more concrete wordage here).
The size of the swapping area or virtual memory file required to support these environments is subject to similar relationships.  Several Symbolics users I have talked to have offered me the rule of thumb that the size of the swapping buffer should be roughly a factor of 4 to 6 times the size of initial sysout as they get it from Symbolics.  Thus most Symbolics users swap off a swapping file of between 80 and 150 MB.  You can imagine why such users look askance at the 1108 with its 40 MB local disk.  However, if one applies the same ratios, which in any case are needlessly generous for the Interlisp-D environment, one gets an expected swapping file size of between 10-15 MB.  In fact, most of our development users at Palo Alto, who stress the system very thoroughly, use swapping buffers of 5-8 MB.  There is no point in going beyond 8 MB in the current implementation of Interlisp-D since that is the maximum size of the entire virtual memory.  When we increase the virtual memory size to 32 MB in the Spring, the need for swapping space will undoubtedly grow.  However, few, if any, of our users should need a swapping file any larger than 16 MB for quite some time to come.  Looked at this way, the 170 MB rigid disks on the 3600s and the Explorers look far less challenging.  Those disks will hold (at fully rated capacity) maybe two active Zetalisp virtual memory swapping areas.  The 40 MB disk on the 1108 holds 3-4 quite comfortably and indeed we standardly configure our machines with three swapping areas on them at the moment.
The real memory required by the systems to operate well is a subject of some controversy simply because there are few reliable, repeatable benchmarks that one can carry out to measure the working sets (i.e., the amount of main memory that a program needs to operate without excessive paging) because this varies dramatically both from one program to another and within one program at different points in time.  Symbolics users feel that 2 MB is the minimum workable memory system on a 3600 and 4 MB is needed to achieve adequate performance.  Once again, note that that figure is above the maximum main memory that we currently offer on an 1108.  For Interlisp-D, however, a rough rule of thumb analogous to that given for the Symbolics equipment is that 1.5 MB is minimal and 2 is comfortable, and with 3.5 on the system one is unlikely to ever write out a dirty page during the course of an average day's work.  The causes of this difference are exceeding subtle and unclear even to us.  If you find yourself in a competitive situation that hinges on an analysis of working set behavior, I strongly advise you to request technical assistance.  The important general point, once again, is that Symbolic has those large real memories available because they need them.
The virtual of the different machines is an area where our competition's edge is perhaps a little more significant.  It is clear that the current 8 MB virtual memory of Interlisp-D has become a chafing limit and hence we will be taking it up to 32 MB in Intermezzo.  Further extensions are possible, but not planned, on the Dandelion hardware.  Our competitors offer virtual memories ranging from the 128 MB of TI through to the over 1 GB virtual memory of Symbolics.  The 128 MB of TI is only a factor of 4 larger than that offered on the Dandelion.  This is not particularly intimidating, especially given the fact that you can point out that the virtual memory image they start with is likely to be a factor of 10 larger.  The Symbolics virtual memory is so much larger that direct comparisons are very unflattering.  They are also somewhat artificial in that the effect of size of virtual memory is clearly limited by the size of the swapping area that one allocates on the local rigid disk.  Very, very few Symbolics users are allocating swapping buffers any larger than 150 MB.  Expressed as a ratio of the size of the initial memory image, this compares reasonably favorably with the 32 MB that will be available to hold the 3 MB Interlisp-D released virtual image.  Nevertheless there is a distinct advantage here in as much as a Symbolics user could allocate the entire of a 470 MB local disk as his swapping buffer should his application really demand that immense amount of main memory.  A user with a genuine need for this will be very hard for us to capture.  However, for most users during standard AI development, the lure of this enormous virtual memory is mainly a mirage.

John,

We are not presently working on an ARPANET gateway to MCI Mail,
although Jon Postel at ISI has a rudimentary one running now
which emulates an interactive user as opposed to using the batch
Mail link protocol (but he did his before such a thing existed).

Mail Link is an interim procedure for exchange of electronic,
postal and telex messages between MCI Mail and public or private
electronic mail systems. It is by no means as ambitious as the
X.400 standard - something we fully expect to implement, but
this will take some time, as I am sure you can imagine.

The Marketing person to talk to at MCI Mail about Mail Link
is Ms. Carla Cotterill. 

I don't have her telephone number at hand (at this hour),
but if you call my secretary, Beverly, at 202-463-3280
and ask her to help you get in touch with Carla, I am
sure that will work.

Or you can compose a message to Intermail@ISIF.
Make sure the first text lines read:

FSR:[ARPANET]Intermail
FSR:[MCIMAIL]227-1077
RSR:[ARPANET]<your ARPANET Mailbox ident>

Then text of the message.

Carla"s MCi Mail ID is 227-1077 and the crude mechanism
above is Jon Postel's intermailer between MCI Mail and ARPANET.

If you wish, you can expand the second FSR a little:

Re: "I think the check before Official Release is to compare {DANTE} to {ERIS} -- there shouldn't be any differences, should there?"    ---  right, the only difference should be the following subdirectories:

<LispNew>Pasa> -- this has versions of INIT files and .CM files specific to Pasadena.

<LispNew>Fonts> -- created by Mike Bird as the customer release font files, some INIT files (INIT.TEST I believe) only look here for fonts rather than poke around phylum etc.

<LispNew>PUB> -- Lorraine keeps all the relevant  documentation here for the Harmony release. This is where she points Gechman's group.

Other than that, {dante}<LispNew> is intended to be isomorphic the {Eris}<Lisp>Harmony>, and {Dante}<LispUsers> to {Eris}<LispUsers> . One day soon I will purge those files that should no longer be on LispNew or LispUsers. (Once I'm sure I won't blow away anything important, I will use COPYFILES and the PURGE option.)

Once the Harmony release is out the door, and done with, everything from {Dante}<LispNew> will move to the very protected {Dante}<Lisp>Harmony> directory and <LipNew> will be replaced with Intermezzo.

From: Raymond Bates <RBATES at ISIB>
To: masinter.pa
Message-ID: <[USC-ISIB.ARPA]29-Nov-84 09:19:33.RBATES>

Here are the changes that Mark Feber had to do to get a newer
version of ISI-Interlisp up and running:
	
AOFD	Added a VAXMACRO prop for MAP.PROCESSES, an Interlisp-D specific 
	function that appeared here.
	Added DECLARE: form to redefine macros \GET & \PUT BASEBYTE
	to be direct calls to 0 functions that do not go through a 
	descriptor.

APRINT	Added functions \DTTYOUTCHARFN, \REMOVEDRIBBLECHECK, \ADDDRIBBLECHECK
	to help the display stuff along.  PARC changed it to make the display
	character output routine independent of dribbling (apparently a 
	separate function is used when dribble is on and when it is off, 
	but these functions are not included on this or the other files).
	Edited \TTYOUTCHARFN to remove the dribbling, and left it in 
	\DTTYOUTCHARFN which is a copy of its namesake.

ATERM	Modified \OPENLINEBUF so that OTHERPROPS has a PROPLIST 
	(\OUTCHAR \BOUT) which \TTYOUTCHARFN expects.  This was not set up
	on any of the new files.
	Removed a clause in \ECHOCHAR which introduced an undefined function
	(DSPXPOSITION).
	Restored old version of PAGEFULLFN as new one contained the udf
	DISPLAYSTREAMP.

BYTECOMPILER
	Replace COMP.GENFN with old definition of GENFN since the new 
	function relies on an "unsupported" version of GENSYM that was
	not supplied.

COREIO	Restored the display IO stuff that was removed, and not, as far 
	as I can tell, replaced by anything comparable.  \OPENLINEBUF in 
	ATERM was still expecting DisplayFDEV to be bound to a STREAM,
	but was, in fact, NOBIND, which broke \OPENLINEBUF.
	Added DECLARE: form to redefine macros \GET & \PUT BASEBYTE
	to be direct calls to 0 functions that do not go through a 
	descriptor.
	COREFILEINFOBLK: Added a (SELECTQ (SYSTEMTYPE) ...) form to the 
	COREFILEINFOBLK record to select LF.EOLC for the end of line 
	convention for the VAX.
	\CORE.OPENFILE: Replaced some (apparently) bogus occurrences of 
	INFOBLOCK with INFOBLK in \CORE.OPENFILE.
	Added DECLARE: form to redefine macros \GET & \PUT BASEBYTE
	to be direct calls to 0 functions that do not go through a 
	descriptor.

FILEIO	Restored old version of \CLOSEFILE as new one contained udf
	IMAGEOP.
	Restored PPSTREAM which disappeared into that good night.
	Added DECLARE: form to redefine macros \GET & \PUT BASEBYTE
	to be direct calls to 0 functions that do not go through a 
	descriptor.

LLREAD	Changed calls to GETBASEBYTE & PUTBASEBYTE to \GETBASEBYTE
	& \PUTBASEBYTE.  

MACHINE	Spelling of BLKLIBARY -> BLKLIBRARY.
	Added functions EVALFORLOAD & LOAD from our src version as they
	were missing in PARC.  Also, used our definition of NAMEFIELD.
	Restored BUILDMAPFLG, UPDATEMAPFLG, and LOADOPTIONS to a VARS
	list on the COMS.

PMAP	Added DECLARE: form to redefine macros \GET & \PUT BASEBYTE
	to be direct calls to 0 functions that do not go through a 
	descriptor.


UNIXIO	Added 	BLOCKIN _ (FUNCTION \PAGEDBINS)
		BLOCKOUT _ (FUNCTION \PAGEDBOUTS)
	to the FDEV creation for {DSK} in \UnixIoInit, making it compatible
	with the new \BINS \BOUTS.
	
VAXLAP & VAXMACROS
	Changed all occurrences of C~~~ to COMP.~~~ to accomodate 
	cosmetic changes in BYTECOMPILER.

VMIOCHAR
	In line with PARC, regularized all \GET \PUT GET PUT BASEBYTE
	to "\" only, with the macro definition using a descriptor.  
	However, since in certain cases the address handed to these macros
	does not include a descriptor (when it is a VMEMPAGE), the files
	PMAP & FILEIO has special VAXMACRO definitions under a DONTCOPY
	DONTEVAL@LOAD DOEVAL@COMPILE DECLARE: form:
		(VAXMACRO (= . 0GetBaseByte)).

SPE or IEEE SE sound like reasonable places for your paper.

I am not sure I agree with you that "one environment is better than another in the same way that one car is better than another -- a combination of small minor engineering details."  Do you think the same thing is true of languages?  I think some of the principles of uniformity, simplicity, powerful combining mechanisms, ... that apply to languages can be appropriately applied to environments as well.  I do agree that people usually don't step back and try to design environments, as opposed to building them bit by bit, and I also agree that our principled understanding is much less advanced and that much of the progress that is made is actually made by building pieces and seeing how valuable they are.*start*

Subject: SERVER sysouts, and other pieces of "small sysout" technology
To: LispCore^
cc: LispSupport, Wogulis.pasa

On [Eris]<LispCore>Databases> are the .cm files for making a "small" sysout onto that directory:
  LoadServer.cm  -- by analogy to [Eris]<LispCore>Next>LoadFull.cm 
                    simply sucks over the other relevant .cm files
  LoadInit.cm    -- sets up LOADUPDIRECTORIES to do a a MAKEINIT on
                    on the <LispCore>Databases> directory
  LoadServerFromDLINIT.cm -- completes the loadup from the INIT.DLINIT 
                    file.   Note that several "patches" are made in this
                    file, since a sysout without some of the basic features
                    tends to be a very fragile item.

I've moved to <LispCore>Sources> the version of APUTDQ which has an extended LOADUP in it (preserving the change of 12/29/84) -- it accepts the argument SERVER, as well as WINDOW, NONET, SMALL, and HUGE (which is synonymous with NIL).  NOTE WELL: some of the files are listed in two places, since the dependencies of recursive calls to LOADUP is no longer describle as a linear column; e.g., BSP appears in the chain beginning with SERVER, as well as in the chain beginning with HUGE. 

Currently the file [Eris]<LispCore>Databases>Server.sysout is about a 1.9MB sysout; more could be excised, but a great deal of work would be required to "put out the fires".  Possibly some splitting of Interlisp source files would be in order.  NOTE ALSO: the SERVER option does not load in DandeLion spcecifics -- since the loadups are being made on a D1, then the disk and ethernet drivers necessare for D0/D1 are already required; thus the SERVER option as currently configured will no run on a DLion.

Primary client right now for the Server.sysout is the remote MONSTER, which has loaded the file [Eris]<LispCore>Databases>System.database (currently, this file is a text version of a masterscope analysis of the system, as produced by DUMPDATABASE, but someday a mshashfile version could be used).  To make a remote MONSTER:
  run the file [Eris]<LispCore>Databases>LoadupMonsterServer.cm 
which will use Server.sysout and System.database as found on [Eris]<LispCore>Databases to produce SystemDatabase.sysout on the same directory.  This sysout may then simply be loaded into any D0 or D1, and be used as a remote MONSTER.


The "technology" for automatically building the two masterscope databases is encapsulated in the files
  [Eris]<LispCore>Databases>MAKE-ABCDATABASE
  [Eris]<LispCore>Library>MAKEDATABASE
  [Eris]<LispCore>Library>SEQUENTIAL
  [Eris]<LispCore>Sources>KNOWNFILES

Kathleen Rose made a trip to San Deigo where she dropped in on UCSD in October.

When I talked to Clay and Tom Logan  I found out that UCSD did not have a maintenance contract.  I told Chris they could either buy a maintenance contract or pay for time and materials.  (We had already made a "gratis" service call.)

Given that some of you haven't been through a PA process before, that it
is rather different than last years anyway, there is no memo from
personnel, and I don't want to have a group meeting, I thought I might
outline it as far as I know so you won't be surprised.  I realize we are
all special cases, I'm describing the default here.  Knowing this place, 
all of these dates will slip, but this is what they claim.  You have
to take this all with a sense of humor.

The procedure is:

Jan 7: PA's turned in.

Its right hand side will be filled out by your immediate supervisor (me
or Brian Smith).  

John S. Brown reads and possibly modifies them.

ISL assigns a number to each of you from 1 through 5.  Meanings are 1:
You are fired, 2: Good, 3: Great, 4: Fantastic, 5: Diety.  The real
meanings of these numbers are unknown to us.  In the old days they were
used to decide raises so they mattered.  We are trying to get rid of
these numbers, but so far without success.

Jan 28: All PAs are turned over the personnel who do whatever with them
(don't know --- probably make sure we don't assign any 5's).

Feb 4: Personnel returns the PAs to us, if everything is ok they are
returned to you.

Feb 15: Your supervisor should finish explaining your PA to you.

Meanwhile raises and promotions are decided.  The system is very
complicated.  In broad brush strokes: There is an average raise for the
entire lab, played as a k%-sum game, i.e., if you give someone a 2k%
raise you have to give someone else a 0% raise to make the average k.
(The value of k is stipulated to be a deep dark secret.) One out of
every l people can be promoted one level; l likewise is a stipulated
secret.  The group of promoted people play another m%-sum game.  Again m
is a stipulated secret.  To the mathematically inclined the average
raise is thus: k+m/l.  The actual system is an order of magnitude more
complex because there are rules about the maximum salary at any grade
level, the number of years you have to be at a grade level before you
can be promoted, k,l,m may be slightly different for different grade
levels, etc.  I'll need a constraint language to figure this all out.

Feb 27: Personnel OK's raises, we start telling you.

Mar 14: Raise discussions are finished.

Mar 15: Your increased pay check arrives (well, maybe not: Above a
certain grade level(13) you get paid once a month, so you might not get
a paid on the 15th.)

(This is tentative).  A plan is being instituted where each of you work out
your goals for the coming year.  I gather this will then be matched
with the PA you turn in 1/86.

I don't want to comment on the merits of this rather complicated scheme.
I just want to say that this new scheme is a direct result of surveys
and committees that all of ISL participated in.  This is Xerox's
Personnel (and the committees) response the the explict wish by most of
the researchers of corporate research to have receive feedback and
guidance about their work and future career's at Xerox.  Xerox is being
responsive to the requests of the researchers.

Caveats: Non-exempt employees will be treated somewhat differently.
CSLI may be treated differently.

I hope this avoids having a group meeting...

Do me a favor, and don't mail this to AILIST^, or I'll have a group
meeting.

Dear Beau Sheil
 
Happy New Year!     I enjoyed New Year's long holidays.

As you know well,we have a plan to integrate JLISP into the newest Interlisp-D  versions(Harmony and Intermezzo) and are very interested in TEdit design for Japanese handling capability.  
These features are greatly signficant for FX-AI business and the research of  Machine Translation.

Now, we have just started to study JLISP integration and TEdit for Japanese.
We will cooperate  with AIBU and PARC peoples in these issues.

The requirement of our cooperative plan is the followings:

1)Discussion channel for TEdit:
For TEdit design from viewpoints of handling Japanese,we need to have discussion channel to the  person who is the responsible for TEdit enhancement. Through this channel, we will inform the person  of our requirements for TEdit with Jpanese handling capability. Could you give me the approval for opening this channel and introduce the best person with handling this issues.  Nori Kamibayashi,Yoshi Ueda and Jyoji Ikeo are working in FX side for this aim.

2)FX engineer's work in AIBU/PARC:
As the results of the discussion through the channel,if it is needed, we will send a FX engineer to AIBU/ PARC.  And he will stay to perform cooperative design,implementation and integration in two or three weeks. We will send him at end of Feburary.  Of cource, the sooner is the better.  we have to develop the TEdit(NS base) with Japanese handling capability because we have to establish the basic environment/tools on Interlisp-D(JLISP) for Machine Translation research till the end of April.

I would like to know your advise on my above proposal. If you basically agree with me, please arrange our plan.

I think that it is the first step of actual AIBU/PARC and FX cooperation in AI field technology. 

Best regards

/Aki

Jon --

There have been some recent developments (I've seen CHAT and file transfer working), but the developer is out of town this week, and I'll need to double check on the status. Part of the problem is that TCP/IP is not scheduled for release until Intermezzo (which comes after Harmony which just got released), and the TCP/IP code relies on some low-level changes which didn't make it for Harmony (e.g., being able to send and recieve odd-length packets.)

Would it make sense for you to be an alpha-test site? I'll have to check about this...

First set:
Mid-March fits with me getting a board in your machine, as I will be on vacation in Feb.

I, or somebody who can run midas, will need to check the board that is at PARC before installation in your machine.  (It would also be nice is Midas could be run after it is installed just to make sure the thing works in your machine.)  If this board is not working we will first replace the chip and, if that does not work, I will send you my board.

Total time to do this -- one day max as I will make sure that my board is working before we start.  I don't think that I would need to come up to PARC but one should consider the cost of a one day trip to PARC.

Second Set:

The cost per board is given in the attached messages.  Note that there is a reduction between the first cut at it and the last.  Although these are some what dated, they should be within a $100 or so per board.

From what I have been told Terry Haney is the one that now in charge of this type of effort.  I will check on this, and if this is the case, will see about handing off the interfacing with Henning at the garage.

The time involved is to get the data to the layout people and interfacing with them.  A rough cut should be about two weeks of my time if there are problems.  (I need to find out how the tape was made for the other Dorado boards and if the machines and software still exist that did it before.)

Third set:

There is no real difference in internal and external use as far as the overhead of making boards.  The difference lies in how many boards are to be made so that the high layout costs can be spread over more boards.

Comments:

I don't think that these are just restated questions from the last message.  My negative attitude in the last message came from your use of "politics" and "perspective" in the request.

Unless you correct it I will take your "I am interested" as meaning it WILL be done and do everything that I can to see that the hardware part of the problem is accomplished as soon as possible.  That is, I will go after Marcel to make sure that he will sign the PO for the film and start that effort and all else needed to make some boards.

I will also upgrade my effort to show CSL that the DES works so that I can push for a commitment from them to help lower the cost per board.

I wrote the hardware handling part of the microcode that was used in the Cedar test and Wille-Sue put it in Cedar (I never used the memory in any of the code that I wrote so she had to modify that part for Cedar).  In addition the DLion mesa head was modified for the Dorado and it will provide you with an example of the difference between the DLion and the Dorado.  Remember that the tests we ran used DLion mesa code.

I once looked over JonL's sholder at the Lisp code for the Ethernet and it looked at that time as if one could copy it and then do a few minor changes to get almost all of the Dorado code.  The problem was in getting the extra microcode to fit in the existing microcode.  JonL pushed lightly for me to add the DLion floating chip set to the board to give him more room in the control store but by that time I thought that the project was dead.


Again I state that if it is REAL, I am ready to go but in the past words have been cheap!

Bill,

	The price of the assembled board depends on the lead time of expected delivery of the boards.  The Long or normal lead time board (36 weeks or so) will cost in the neighborhood of $ 2,659.03 per.
	The faster turn around ( 16 to 20 weeks ) will cost in the neighborhood of $ 3,624.36 per. 
These prices are based on a buy or build of 25 units.  Prices will go down on larger builds.

John

 My thanks to Robert for doing the analysis.

They quoted $65 per chip or about $13k when I talked to them.

For a build of 25 this adds $520 perboard for a total cost of $3179.03.

The price is about $1100 higher than I had guessed that it would be.  ECL parts must cost a LOT!

I will forward the information to those that wanted to know.

Boy, do those ECL parts cost -- my best guess was WAY low.  See the attached message from John Henning as to the cost of doing the board.

To his numbers one must add $520, for a build of 25, for the creation of the film for the board.  (The total cost of the film is about $13K.)  Using John's number we get for 25 boards --

36 or so weeks =  $3179 per board!

16 to 20 weeks = $4144 per board!!

Note that these times do not include the layout time.

Your right about the board cost.  We made an error in the estimation the revised cost estimate is, for 25 boards, less layout and film:
Long lead		Faster turn around
$1,770.56			$2,735.90

According to the attached message there was an error in the first estimate from John Henning.  To these we must add the cost of film ($13000) or $520 per board for a build of 25.

This makes the costs--
Long lead = $1770 + $520 = $2290
Short lead = $2736 + $520 = $3256

(I feel better as this is much closer to my "rough guess".)

Ok in /user/xascons/ilisp you will find ilisp.  This is the

/usr/include/vadvise.h.  This file was on our 4.2 distribution
tape I think and defines 3 variables for the system call vadvise.
This system call works for both version 4.1 or 4.2 but the
documentation set for version 4.2 leaves is out (but does mention
it in describing ps).  Another nice unix wart.  Those people
running spice tend to use up most of the virtual memory available
on your vax, so watch out, Interlisp tends to die when running
out of virtual memory.  "make ilisp" can loop if you run out of

In general, Artificial Intelligence Systems strongly supports the move to make XNS interoperable with IEEE 802.3 standard networks.  In particular, we will take direct steps to remove the incompatibility caused by the assignment of the PUP type number from existing 10 MHz networks, both internally and in our customer base.  However, Geoff Thompson's proposed policy statement is a little draconian given the realities of our market place.  Specifically, since we sell workstations into mixed vendor networking environments, we must accommodate to the networking strategies that those customers have chosen.  To the extent possible, we try to influence them to select XNS as their network family.  However, in many cases, even the customers do not have that liberty.  For example, many of them are required to implement and use TCP/IP in order to be in conformance with U.S. Government funding requirements.  In other cases, we have to coexist with non-XNS networking families because they are either on site already or offer us facilities that XNS does not.  Unfortunately (from the XNS standardization point of view) 
PUPS are such a family.

Due to their wide dispersal during the Alto-based University grants program, some of our customers, particularly in the universities, have substantial PUP-based networks.  Furthermore, this family was used to implement some services, such as random access to files stored on a Vax, which are not even now readily available in other networking families.  For this reason, we must continue to support our customers with PUP-based networks, at least until we are able to provide them with a superior networking strategy which meets all their needs.  Even then, the process of conversion can be expected to be drawn out over time, much as it is within Xerox internally.

The bulk of our customers who use PUP protocols now do so by sending them encapsulated on the 10 MHz wire and thus would fall afoul of the incompatibility between the old encapsulation and IEEE 802.3.  Those whose networking software comes almost entirely from Xerox, we can upgrade to the new encapsulation standard as soon as it is settled on and implemented within Xerox. Tentatively we would plan to do this in our next release of Interlisp software, scheduled for late spring of 1985. However, there do exist installations (Stanford University being a prime example) who encapulate a significant amount of PUP traffic using non-Xerox software and hardware.  It may be quite difficult for these customers to convert to the new encapsulation standard, at least quickly.  For that reason we will also provide our customers the option, although it will not be the standard software that we release, to continue to use the old encapsulation standard on the 10 MHz wire.  Customer sites which elect to do that will do so having been clearly advised by us that making this choice will prevent them from interconnecting their networks to IEEE 802.3 equipment.  Presumably they would only do this if the cost of converting were higher than the attractions of IEEE 802.3 compatibility, but we cannot presume to make these choices for our customers unilaterally.

In summary then, we will support the XNS/IEEE 802.3 interoperability as aggressively as we can.  We will support the new encapsulation as soon as possible.  We will upgrade as many of our sites as we can and we will continue our efforts to move our customers to more modern networking families.  However, clearly we cannot impose this transition on our customers heavy handedly, any more than we have been willing to do so internally upon ourselves.

I hope you find this course of action in compliance with the spirit of the policy that you have suggested.

The internal implementation of "remote workstation" capabilities is called "Phonenet". While 820s and the like have been able to dial into a SIU (Shared Interface Unit) and become "full network citizens" for about a year now, the version of Star that implements remote workstation is just now being released to customers with OS 5.0. OSD has had the capability internally for quite some time.

We're trying to avoid spending much time on developing any pup-based networking systems; most of the networking development has gone into things like NS mail, NS chat, performance tuning, and the TCP/IP work.

To: IFSAdministrators^.pa

Reply-to: Axelrod.WBST

This message is to alert IFS Administrators to a problem that could prove embarrassing and perhaps costly to individuals and local organizations and to the Corporation.

It has been noted that digitized graphical images of questionable propriety and taste have been stored on file servers at various locations.  These images were designed to be displayed on workstations and printed on network printers.  Some people find these images distasteful and offensive.  In some cases, it is possible that there are legal sanctions that may be invoked by people who are offended in this way.  In any case, it is against Xerox policy to permit company resources to be used in a way that might reasonably be regarded as offensive.

All IFS Administrators are urged to determine whether such images are stored on the file servers under their jurisdiction.  If so, they should be removed.

No constructive purpose would be served by widespread publicity.  Of course, if files in individual directories are to be deleted, good manners dictate that the individuals be informed of the reasons.   Beyond that, it is unlikely that any further announcements should be made.

Thus far, the Research InterNet has been exempted from some restrictive regulations that are ordinarily placed on Corporate information resources.  This has been a conscious decision on the part of senior management, and is due both to the effective use that the technical community has made of the network, and also to our admirable record of self-policing.  Steps taken now on our own initiative, without any further senior management intervention, will help sustain this status.   

Administrators who are unsure of their obligations may wish to consult with their own management.  Any questions may be directed to me, or to Jack Dolan, Manager, Rochester Technical Computer Center, <Dolan.Wbst>, 8*222-2100 or Bob Feeley, Manager, Information Services Section, Webster Research Center, <Feeley.wbst>, 8*222-5425.

I just got your note. Just for some clarification... I work for PARC. The AI Systems product (1108 with Interlisp-D) is an outgrowth of a PARC project, and I spend almost all of my time working with XAIS (as we tend to call them around here) on software development, and recruiting, etc. (I'm curious who referred you to me for "AI orientation".)

I'm travelling most of February, and so don't want to schedule any long-term discussions until March. 

In general, there's a tremendous amount of trade and popular press on AI.... if you get Dialog or its nighttime Knowledge Index and do a retrieval on Artificial Intelligence or Expert Systems or Lisp or Prolog and throw in a couple of the company names that are AI-specific (Intellicorp (Intelligenetics), Teknowledge, Symbolics, Inference), you get literally hundreds of references. The piece from Engineering Manager is typical, and relatively weak compared to some.

I think a strategic plan should also address some organizational issues, like ability to respond fairly quickly to market developments. The grapevine of friends in development point to some interesting novel competitive developments which Xerox should be prepared to meet if they come to pass. (I assume a 5-year plan has multiple contingencies?)

I got both copies of your cover letter. While I'll forward your resume around, I'll quite frankly tell you my impression, which is that your note describes quite a bit of what Xerox could do for you, but not much about what it is you could do for Xerox. In the world, folks with ability but no vision are clearly limited, but the converse isn't adequate either. You use words like "I fantasize ...", "I'd like to ... " , "I'm interested in ...", "I have a pretty broad vision of ...". But what I was looking for were things like "I've had some experience with X, and would like to continue...". Or, "I developed a Y on my 1108s, and would like to see it better integrated into the total environment...". 

I'm somewhat of a pragmatist. I think ideas are cheap. I can get neat ideas just looking out the window. What's hard is making them work, grunt level bit twiddling tedious boring debugging sloshing code around. To make the analogy, I'm looking for bricklayers and carepenters, not people who want to paint pictures of buildings. 

I'd think, given that you managed to get somebody to buy some machines, that you could *DO* something with them. I dunno what. How about a "variable-speed stepper that runs both forward and backward, a la the Cornell Program Sythesizer" for Interlisp? 

I sometimes get in trouble when I send out essays online.

Well, I think most of the librarians at Xerox are on the net. If you want to order technical research reports, you can send mail to Library@Xerox.

I don't know who's at Indiana that I know. I bump into people at conferences, I suppose. 

I can't think of anybody from HS days that I've kept in touch with. My folks are back in San Antonio, so I get there fairly frequently. 

Did I say? I live in the silicon valley suburbs; my wife spends most of her time practicing (cello) when she isn't taking care of our two boys: Michael is 5 and Joseph is 3. They're wonderful and smart and silly and I love them tons.

I'm home with the flu the last couple of days; I have my Radio Shack portable hooked up so I can type in bed... it doesn't inspire long essays, however.

Bob,

I'd like to share the work of generating technical information with some of the other people in the development staff. While I'd be happy to see you regularly here; would it be appropriate to suppliment your visits with queries to LispCore^ on specific technical details?

Symbolics has a lovely 3600 Technical Summary, which I think is a buyer's delight -- technical in detail, and overall a great sales pitch. I'd love to see something like that come out of Xerox, and am willing to pitch in a share of supplying any information that isn't otherwise available.

In general, comparing with Symbolics is hard for us to do here. We don't have one, and even if we did, it wouldn't be  an integral part of our daily work environment. I'm not a great source of information of what Symbolics machines do and don't do, because I don't use one, and haven't for more than a few minutes. I try to talk to people who do use Symbolics machines, including Eric Schoen (Schoen.PA) who works on one at Stanford, and Jan Pedersen (Pedersen.PA) who had one at Stanford Stats department, and Gregor Kizales, who works on the ARI project at PARC and used to be on the Symbolics software development staff. But I'd rather not be a bottleneck in the information flow; I'll be happy to introduce you next time you're around with a list of Symbolics questions, and let you at them direct. I'm also sure that in our customer base there are a number of customers who have both Symbolics and Xerox and are willing to share both their positive and negative feelings about the machines if someone were willing to go and listen and take some notes. I'll be happy to help review the notes and look for specifics that are either shortfalls that we need to address or strong points that we could push more in the marketing of our products. I'd not like to be the one to conduct the interviews, however. Do our sales reps have any mechanism of reporting back either compliments or complaints?

One thing in particular: I would very much like to get copies of anything that *does* get distributed to the field, both to review it, and also to give me some encouragement that things actually reach the reps.


To get to your specific questions:

About benchmarking:
You're right, benchmarking won't go away. I and vanMelle recently wrote a new summary paper on Lisp benchmarking, "Measuring Lisp Performance", which will be presented by Bill at the Spring CompCon in San Francisco. It includes a list of "Bogus Lisp Benchmarks" which you and the field might find amusing.  In particular, the figures Symbolics is spreading as far as Sweden include old 1108 timings (we've gotten a lot better since), and "new" 3670 timings which include hardware they haven't yet released. (#10 on the list of Bogus Lisp Benchmarks).  I've recieveda paper comparing TI to Symbolics which includes much technical detail about both, and we will need to have a good position on how we stack up against TI in the near future.

I think we need some internal help from someone who can run benchmarks and give us performance comparisons before they get published, especially before we release them as official "dandetiger" benchmarks. JonL had been doing some of this, although I've never seen any of the figures he generated and have no idea where we stand on the infamous Gabriel benchmarks. Are you willing to help?

On measuring programmer productivity:
The August 1984 issue of Systems & Software contains an article AI environment speeds software development, which is basically an ad for Symbolics talking about how their environment speeds the development cycle. However, its clear from their description of how programmers spend their time that their environment is still quite cumbersome. Their own chart "Compare and contrast" would make a good starting place for a comparison with our system, where you don't "switch" from the Editor to the Debugger-- they're both up on the screen, and you just point. ZetaLisp is a very "modal" system because of their cumbersome window system.

About CDR-codes:
We use an 8-bit CDR-code. Symbolics uses a 2-bit CDR-code. Far more pointers can be addressed with 8 bits than 2, and RPLACA and RPLACD in place are much more likely to be useful.  (The downside of this is that they have more bits for virtual address.)

Symbolics is finally releasing a working garbage collector with their release 6.0,  so "their GC doesn't work" is finally no longer something we can use in the marketplace. (sigh -- for years, their customers have been suffering, but its too late to use effectively as a marketing tool when they can counter about their "wonderful new garbage collector".)

About future performance on the DTiger over the current state:
We can expect over the long run as much as a 20-30% across the board performance gain, although of course I would be foolish to make specific promises. I could imagine getting more performance out of the DLion and its successors with more investment than we can currently put into it. (While recruiting in the development organization as a whole has been going well, we've yet to hire anyone, especially anyone senior, into the Lisp Software area.) 

In any case, individual computations can easily get as much as 100% faster. (The transcendentals SIN and COS and SQRT will be about 5 times faster with the new compiler stuff, which may or may not make it completely by Intermezzo.)

About amount of time in run-time type checking:
The last I measured, run-time type checking accounted for about 5% of all processor cycles. (This was measured on a Dorado, but I'm pretty confident that the result carries over to the DLion.)

About process switching cost:
Process switching is more expensive in ZetaLisp because ZetaLisp is shallow-bound, and to switch contexts in a shallow-bound enviornment, you have to unwind and rewind all of the bindings of all fluid variables. 

About kinds of macros:
We have 4 different kinds of macros in Interlisp-D, substitution, computed, LAMBDA and OPENLAMBDA. Each has their own advantages in conceptual simplicity. Unlike ZetaLisp, Interlisp-D uses macros both for defining syntactic extensions, and also for writing "optimizers" -- ways of rewriting the code that are not used at interpretation time but that the compiler takes cognizance of. In ZetaLisp, a symbol can either be a macro or a function. However, functions can have "optimizers". In Interlisp-D, a symbol can have both a macro and a function definition. If it has a function definition, the macro is only used as an "optimizer" recognized by the compiler, and the function definition takes precedence in the interpreter.

OK?

The following is a summary of conversations held on Thu Jan 24 between
    Bill Spencer, Vice-President and Manager of XEROX PARC,
    Bernard Mont-Reynaud, Research Associate at CCRMA, and
    Robert Poor, technical coordinator at CCRMA.

Before the summary proper comes a bit of background history.
Ideas regarding possible cooperative action between XEROX and CCRMA (the
Center for Research in Computer Music and Acoustics at Stanford) have been 
exchanged since the spring of 1984.  The technical areas under discussion
include:
    - a workbench for the analysis of acoustic signals,
    - tools for editing and printing of musical scores, and
    - tools for reasoning about abstract representations of music.

Both XEROX and CCRMA have accumulated expertise in these areas, although
with a different emphasis.  In particular, work done at XEROX in each of 
these three areas seems to be quite independent of the work done in other
areas.  By contrast, the progress of CCRMA's NSF-funded project in machine
transcription of performed music is dependent upon integrating tools from
all three areas.  XEROX 1108's, with the INTERLISP-D and fast floating-point 
arithmetic available from LISP, seem ideally suited for this research.
Conversely, the transcription system, together with its ramifications at 
the level of sound analysis/synthesis and musical score editing/printing,
should provide a striking demonstration of the capabilties of the 1108's.

In the latter part of December 1984, two 1108s were delivered to CCRMA, on
an extended loan basis.  This should allow the NSF project to continue its
progress, and give CCRMA time to seek equipment grants towards purchases.
The general understanding is that XEROX makes certain hardware and software
available to CCRMA, while CCRMA makes available to XEROX any software that
it develops in the D machine environment.  More specific legal agreements
need to be worked out.

This was background history, now comes the meeting of Jan 24.  Following
greetings and warm-ups, Bernard Mont-Reynaud reports on recent events:
    - Lisp and D-machine instruction:
	a hands-on workshop was held in the Dandelion room at CSLI, and
	attended by 12 CCRMA people; further sessions were held at CCRMA.
    - increasing supply to face increasing demand:
	two Dandelions are now rented from CSLI
    - generally, the CCRMA-CSLI relations are increasing bandwidth.  For
	example, CSLI's Thursday seminar of Feb 7 will be a presentation/demo
	of the transcription project, on CCRMA grounds.
    - CCRMA is gearing up for transporting software from the SAIL world to the
	INTERLIPSP world.  The bulk of this task can be done automatically, in
	two steps.  The first step (now almost completed) runs under SAIL, and
	converts SAIL programs to `Prefix SAIL', an intermediate language which
	has LISP-like appearance but retains SAIL semantics.  The output of the
	first phase is transferred to D machines using the net.  The second step
	(not yet implemented) will run in LISP and convert Prefix SAIL to Lisp. 
	Further manual editing may be required whenever there is no good mapping
	of SAIL constructs to INTERLISP constructs, but this should be only for
	handling exceptional situations, not the bulk of the code.

The status of the three areas of the project (acoustic analysis, musical analysis,
and musical score editing/printing) were then reviewed, in order to identify the
needed actions.

In the acoustic analysis area, the goal is to expand XEROX's speech workbench
both by adding signal processing functions, such as the `constant-Q FFT' method,
and by modifying the user interface and the programmer's interface.  As was
discussed in earlier meetings involving XSIS staff (notably Steve Purcell),
CCRMA staff, and linguist Henri Thomson from Edinborough,  the idea is that
tools currently available at XEROX will be made available to CCRMA, which will
in return make available any extensions it develops.  Software exchanges between
CCRMA and other laboratories outside XEROX that share an interest in the development
of an acoustic analysis workbench, such as CSLI and Edinborough, will be handled
primarily through XSIS, acting as a clearinghouse for software developments.

All that is needed to get this process started is a legal clearance, whereby 
(say) Steve Purcell would feel free to hand over a copy of the audio workbench
software, and related tools, to the CCRMA group.  

In the musical analysis area, the plan is to convert the current SAIL software
to the INTERLISP environment, and then extending it by taking advantage of the
more powerful environment.  This can benefit from access to INTERLISP tools in
user libraries, but otherwise draws almost exclusively on CCRMA resources.

In the area of music score manipulation, it is important to see that sophiticated
editing (such as provided by Mockingbird) is NOT critical to the research effort
in the transcription project.  Access to music printing is critical.  This can
be achieved in the immediate future by:
  (a) a simple facility for printing from a note list to the screen (from which
	hard copies can be obtained on a printer server -- these are `working'
	copies rather the publishing quality copies)
  (b) an interface to Leland Smith's MS program to produce high-quality output.

Later, it will become important to have high-quality music printing within the
D machine environment, but the needs of the project are well served temporarily
by using the F4 environment (b) for the occasional publication-quality needs.
More critical to the research at this point is the `quick-and-dirty' score display
facility ((a) above).

In building such a facility, the project could save much time by having access to
the sources of the Mockingbird software, if only to use some of the simpler parts
of it, such as the definition of musical fonts.  However, it seems important to
guard against a possible misinterpretation of CCRMA's intentions here.  The NSF 
project has NO intention to finish the reimplementation of Mockingbird (Mesa) in
the INTERLISP and Loops environment.  The latter project, which is dear to John
Maxwell's heart, cannot be addressed by the NSF group, especially as the goal is
to develop a product.

From the above, and after discussion with Bill Spencer, the following action
items emerged.

Printer:

	Rob Poor will contact Bill Winfield regarding the loan of a laser printer
	to CCRMA, which Bill Spencer has, in principle, approved.

Legal clearances:

	Steve Purcell and Bernard Mont-Reynaud will work together on preparing
	notes to XSIS, PARC and the LA distribution office that Bill Spencer may
	then sign.  The purpose of the LA letter is to grant CCRMA a no-fee
	software license agreement, which will give CCRMA access to the standard
	releases of software.  The purpose of the letters to XSIS and PARC is to
	grant access to special software packages that are available from them
	only.  The list of these special packages will be prepared by Mont-Reynaud
	and Purcell jointly.  It is presumed that it will include the speech work-
	bench with the underlying siganl processing and graphics tools, the IDL
	package for scientific data display, and the sources of the partial 
	reimplementation of Mockindird in INTERLISP.  

	A XEROX lawyer will also be contacted to help check the nature of these
	agreements between CCRMA and XEROX, especially with respect to CCRMA's
	obligations regarding the non-dissemination of confidential information,
	and to help write them up in proper form.

The above summary was written by Bernard Mont-Reynaud.  It should be reviewed by
Bill Spencer before one may assume that XEROX's intentions have been correctly
represented.  However, since Bill is out of town for two weeks, it might be
possible to start work on some of the action items before his return, such as
preparing the letters that need Bill's signature.

There appears to be a bug in LOAD? in Harmony.  LOAD? is roughly

(LAMBDA (FILE LDFLG PRINTFLG)
    (if (NULL (GETP (NAMEFIELD FILE) 'FILEDATES))
     then (LOAD FILE LDFLG PRINTFLG)]

An initial (LOAD? 'MOCKUP.DCOM) puts a FILEDATES property on the atom
MOCKUP.LSP .  Any subsequent LOAD? looks on the property list of the
different atom MOCKUP, and failing to find a FILEDATES property there,
reloads the file!

I would like to point out a few things about the bad page table problem
( It happened to me under Carol )


1/	In theory, the Diagnostics Floppy ( we're running version 5.0 )
	should catch the error, but DOESN'T. Instead the floppy reports
	that all is well, no problems.

2/	This makes it IMPOSSIBLE for a non-Xerox insider to detect the
	error, except by noticing the frequent crashes ( daily ), the
	hard-disk error code ( 0915, I believe ), or obtaining the 
	top-secret password from Xerox ( ha! ) and instructions on how
	to use the password ( double ha! ). 

3/	In other words, this is a MAJOR BUG. We have no way to check
	out our bad page tables, no way to get into the tables ourselves,
	and no word from Xerox about a problem that probably has occurred
	previously. The only way to solve the problem is to pay a serviceman
	to reinstall the bad page sectors manually. Once again, the
	they-don't-need-to-know-internals policy has become the 
	time-to-bail-out-Xerox problem. Sigh!

Summary of Symptoms of Erased Bad Page Tables:

a)	frequent crashes

b)	0915 hard-disk error code

c)	Errors in retrieving files from the hard disk. i.e. files
	that were saved correctly are not retrievable ( because the
	file was written over bad sectors ).

d)	CopyVMem errors. From the LispInstallationTool, 
	When copying virtual memory from one lisp image
	to another, the copy is written on bad sectors. The result is 
	that a freshly reloaded image either crashes soon after you first
	enter it, or the UserExec never comes up at all ( It crashed
	before you ever used it! ).

e)	Errors in files copied from the hard disk to the floppies

f)	In short, any operation that stores information on the hard disk
	is subject to this bug.


Truly yours,

	Eric Hestenes

p.s. They found one extra bad page on our hard disk too. Do you suppose
     that Xerox leaves one bad page out of the table on each machine, 
     just to keep us on our toes? Thank goodness for the BPT erasure,
     because without it we would never have found that lone bad page.

It is a real pain to have someone like Eric Ostrom flame in your direction.
Please understand that Eric tends to fly off the handle wildly sometimes
and those flames are generally not the official position of CSLI.  His
note was rather rambling and seemed to be an off-the-cuff remark.


(Of course, CSLI does have some problems with Xerox but I am not aware
of any significant problems with PARC.  None of the problems are
insurmountable or prevent us from using the Dandelions--just a few
stubbed toes.)

	Mabry Tyson

P.S.  It is interesting to note that when we got the first shipment
of Dlions and brought them up ourselves, we clobbered the bad page
table my doing (if I remember right) New Disk Checkout.  Ie, we didn't
follow instructions.  (That last statement should be moderated by
the fact that the disks did not have the software on them when delivered
as the instructions indicated so we couldn't follow the instructions
exactly anyway.)

Brad Horak (Brad@CSLI) is our conduit for bug reports.  He collects them for
CSLI and sends them in.

But since you asked, we have one frustrating bug that has been bothering
us for two+ months that we haven't been able to get any feedback on at all
(not even "We're working on it").  I would suggest Xerox might want to
make sure every bug report gets some sort of timely response (even if it is
just a "We have assigned it bug report number N") and then some sort of
follow-up later on.  


I can realize that this bug is not one reproducible at Xerox and so might
be very hard to make sure it is fixed right.  The particulars are as follows
(fyi only--I would expect bug fixes to come through the normal channels).

We have developed code for our VAX that handles TCP/IP, CHAOS, and PUP all
in one system.  It is not the old Unix code.  David Kashtan did this work.
The problem lies in CHATting between a Dlion and the Vax.  David believes
the old Unix code worked by sending a packet and waiting for an ack.
Apparently the protocols allow you to send a set of packets and then wait
for an ack on all/some of them.  David implemented this (to speed up
the CHAT and to reduce the load on the Vax) but we ran into an apparent
bug at the DLion end.

There is a queue of packets that is kept associated with the CHAT connection
and a counter which (I believe) relates to the number of unprocessed packets
in that queue.  The problem is that we find the count at 0 when the queue
is non-empty.  The effect is that the echo (when typing in) is n-characters
behind.  (When you type a character and the echoing packet comes back, the
count is incremented to 1 and so the processes pulls the next packet off the
queue (and decrements the count to 0).  Of course that packet was N characters
back...)

I have a hack to get around it by forcing the count to be the length of that
queue.  But you have to do that relatively often.

We encountered this bug before CSLI had access to sources and it was a trick
to track it down through the object code.  Since then I have glanced at the
code but don't feel like I am proficient enough to know just what locks
need to be put in or where.

Oh.. I didn't explain why we think the problem occurs.   When the process
that empties the queue pulls out a packet, it does something like (SETQ
COUNT (SUB1 COUNT)).  However, if a packet arrives between the evaluation
of count and its subsequent re-setting the process that puts packets onto
the queue would have incremented the count.  But then when that expression
is finished, the count is one too low.   When the two hosts are in lock-step
by not sending a second packet until the previous one was ACKed, this
couldn't happen.


As you see, this is a bug that probably can't be replicated at Xerox.  But
it is also one that causes us pains and one that none of us feel we want
to tackle.

Here is a slightly edited version of the summary Larry sent me.  The presenter will be Larry Masinter, Xerox PARC.  Please let me know if it needs to be edited down further.


Research in Artificial Intelligence has frequently led to exploration of new programming paradigms and programming languages oriented toward representing and manipulating information about the world in symbolic form.  Recently, such AI techniques have found a growing number of commercial applications.  Part of the reason for growth has been the development of a number of AI programming toolkits, which contain novel elements of programming language and tools for dealing with constructs such as knowledge bases, object hierarchies, rule languages and the like.  This tutorial will describe some of the commercial AI environments and the ways in which they've expanded on the underlying Lisp programming environments on which they are built.

I understand bugs, and am willing to help fix them.  What I do not understand
is the apparent Xerox attitude (from the outside) that they do not exist.
To pretend that a system as complex as Interlisp-D can possibly be bug free
is ridiculous.  I think that the D-lion is a fine machine, but it has serious
problems.  I see Xerox devoting attention/resources to adding features rather
than fixing the existing system.  I see researchers supporting a system.
This can't work for long.  Sorry if my resulting grumpiness makes me overly
obnoxious.  I didn't know that 1100-users had been cc'd.

	Enjoyed reading your brief update essay, composed during the height
of the flu season.  Gosh, I hope I don't get it!

	Of great interest to me was your comment that your wife is a cellist.
Professional?  Reason being is that I took up the cello a couple of years ago.
This had been one of my lifelong dreams, because there had been this old cello
(belonged to my grandfather) around my mother's house, unplayed for > 30 yrs.
I finally had the money to pay for its restoration, and took lessons for a
year or so.  Well I don't get much time to practice, and I would like to take
more lessons.  I play little baroque pieces.  I also play the flute still, but
I now find the cello more satisfying.

	My "personal physicist" also plays the cello (from hight school
orchestra days.  Now and then we have been able to get people together for
some chamber music.

	At some point I will probably be joining him in New York.  He just
found a place to live--a small_ssmall apartment in Queens.  I still have much to
accomplish in my present job before I can entertain making a graceful exit
here.  It is my hope that after 1 year, some opportunity out West might
arise for him.  The crud that one has to put up with in N.Y. is really a lot,
I think.

	This is being done in my office on an hp terminal.  I have been
considering getting a microcomputer for use at home, probably a Macintosh.

My wife took up the cello about 6 years ago; she'd been a piano major as an undergrad but hadn't studied it before. She's been taking lessons regularly and now plays in a community orchestra and in a quartet. The quartet got paid to play at a couple of weddings-- does that make them professional?

There's a book by John Holt about his experiences learning to play the cello as an adult, which I would recommend, at least from the excerpts I read.

The Mac is cute enough, if you get it on the one of the big university discounts (Stanford students could buy them for under $1K.) I'm finding it hard to believe that anyone would buy a computer with their own money, though, given the rate things are going...

There have been some recent developments (I've seen CHAT and file

is not scheduled for release until Intermezzo (which comes after Harmony
which just got released), and the TCP/IP code relies on some low-level

Subject: Franz to Interlisp conversion

We have just acquired a bunch of 1108s running Interlisp-D.  We have
a large chunk of existing Franz Lisp code running on our VAXes.  I am
looking for help in translating the Franz code to Interlisp.  It looks
like my best hope is that someone out there has a really slick transor
package for the conversion, but I am a real innocent when it comes to
Interlisp, so any help would be valuable.

I am new to the mailing list, so this may have already been thoroughly
hashed out before.  In any case, please reply directly to me, and I will
summarize for the list (if it seems desirable to do so).

This message is long, but please try to go over it carefully and give us your reactions; you represent a very nebulous consortium of administrators who need to make some very crisp decisions.  The opinions expressed below represent the consensus of the developers and maintainers of the Pup and NS internetwork software.

We need to address two important topics that will have to involve all network administrators:
	(1) The increasing difficulty of maintaining network software on obsolete hardware (we
	    present below some proposals that you should probably treat as ultimatims).
	(2) The desire for an explicit plan to phase out the long-distance telephone lines connecting
	    major sites in the existing Research Internet (we introduce some ideas that we hope will
	    form the basis for constructive discussions).
Both issues must be addressed now, since they deal with changes that must occur during 1985.

We have coined a new term -- the "Constellation" -- to represent a cluster of networks, under the control of a single administration (or a small cooperating group of them), generally associated with a single site or campus within the Xerox Research Internet (RIN).  Within a constellation there is a lot of flexibility in the protocols supported, the equipment used to connect networks, and the way that the sites are administered.  For instance, we expect that Pup traffic will continue to be supported within many of the existing RIN constellations for some time to come.   Examples of existing constellations are the PARC/OSBUNorth complex, the A&E/CP10 complex, and Art Axelrod's Webster/Henrietta empire.  Constellations are connected by RIN lines, Corporate Internet (CIN) lines, or both.  We will use this concept heavily in the remainder of the discussion.

1. Obsolete Equipment -- Dolphin (D0) and Alto Servers

Altos: There are still 23 Alto gateways (internetwork routers) connecting RIN networks.  Some only  serve to connect Ethernets to each other, others include phone lines as well.  These servers can route both Pup and NS traffic.  The last change to the Alto software was made about three years ago.   There are bugs in the Alto implementation that cause serious performance problems, and others that destroy the accuracy and integrity of the time-of-day services.  These problems have been or are being repaired in the Pilot (non-Alto) versions of the software.  It is our position that these machines cannot continue to be accommodated (tolerated?) within the various RIN constellations after the end of 1985.  We will talk about the Dolphin problem before presenting some alternatives for people who are operating these gateways.

Dolphins: About 24 Dolphin gateways remain.  Since Dolphins do not have phone line hardware, they are all being used within constellations to connect Ethernets (of both speeds) together.  None can be replaced by Dandelion-based routers without suffering severe performance and cost penalties, since it takes 2*(N-1) Dandelions and (N-1) RS232 lines to interconnect N Ethernets (fewer processors once multi-line communications boards become available).

Trouble is, no one (that we know of) has the responsibility to maintain Dolphin software.  When new versions of Pilot, Tajo, and the Pilot-based routing services are released the Dolphin is left behind unless and until a volunteer is found to bring it up to date.  This is about to happen again, with the Yuba release.  This release, coming soon, contains significant improvements to the communications code.  This code will not be fully effective until all the gateways are running it.  Again, the older implementations can be tolerated only until the end of the year.

Alternatives: There are two ways each installation can deal with this coming obsolescence: phase out its older gateways (the only option for Alto owners), or find a way to update the Dolphin code.  We consider each here:

. Phase-out: There are no NS products with the capabilities for interconnecting Ethernets.  The only known alternatives are to use the multiple-Dandelion method described above, or to install Dicentras as gateways (*).   Since Dicentras do not have disks, one also needs to provide boot-services and name-lookup services through small numbers of additional Dandelions.  The present Dicentra build is completely committed, but we are willing to initiate another build if there is sufficient interest (and soon!)  Within PARC and OSBU North, we are planning to phase out all of our Dolphin gateways this year. 

(*) The AISBU manufactures a Dandelion-upgrade called a Dandetiger.  Limited numbers of Dandetigers have been equipped with an outboard Multibus adapter that lets you connect to commercial devices, like 10MB Ethernet boards.  Questions remain about availability and throughput of this lashup, but it could form an attractive alternative to Dicentra in some installations.

. Upgrade: If you know how to maintain them, Dolphins remain a reasonable choice for gateways and their related boot and name services.  Machine-dependent changes for Yuba are limited to a few of the device drivers ("heads"); no microcode changes are required.  We propose that the organizations that intend to keep their Dolphins find a way to provide the necessary programming.  More on that later.

Grapevine: Virtually all of the grapevine servers will have been converted to Dandelions (or supplanted by NS Mail servers) by this autumn.  If you are still operating an Alto Grapevine server and have no conversion plans, we should talk.

2. The future of the Research Internet

The Corporate Internet (CIN) exists.  It is within a site or two of connecting all of the major centers served by the RIN.  At this point, it appears to be well ahead of the schedule we had originally projected for it; stable performance under extremely heavy load, however, has not yet been demonstrated, nor has its cost-effectiveness compared with what we are paying for the RIN.

At the same time, the RIN remains heavily overloaded, primarily due to congestion on some of the long-distance lines.  Either these facilities must be upgraded, or we must reduce or eliminate the RIN traffic.  Whatever solution we come up with should consider, in additional to the service requirements, the overall cost to Xerox and to the individual organizations.

Before considering a fairly radical proposal, we should emphasize that we expect Pup-based applications and other forms of nonstandard solutions (such as non-product internetwork hardware and software) to continue to thrive (begin emphasis) within many of the constellations (end emphasis) for some time to come.  There are no short-term credible means for replacing all of the IFS's, Spruce printers, and other more specialized Pup-based services and applications.  Nor does the continued existence of Pups cause much trouble within a constellation.  (In fact, it can be argued that the need to support a heterogeneous collection of protocols within an internetwork serves a valuable research purpose -- the world's going to be like that.)  We believe that protecting the Corporate Internet from pollution is a solved problem, even when the CIN is connected to constellations that still carry internal Pup traffic.

So here are two questions we would like to address:  Could we do without Pup-based communications among constellations?  And if so, could we move quickly to transfer all of our inter-constellation traffic to the Corporate Internet?  Clearly the decision to pull the "Pup plug" can be made independently by the managements of each constellation.  We would like to have a discussion among the affected organizations, though, in hopes that this transition might happen both sooner and more smoothly.

The primary argument for this change would be to simplify the process of engineering adequate overall capacity for Xerox NS traffic, placing the whole thing in the hands of the GSD people who run the CIN.  They have assured everyone that they welcome the traffic and will move aggressively to accommodate it -- and that they understand the need for reserve capacity to assure decent responsiveness.

The primary argument against it is that there may be needs for Pup transmission among sites that cannot readily be met some other way.  Here are some major examples and a brief discussion:

Mail: There exists a gateway implementation that supports transmission of Grapevine-originated mail to NSMail recipients and vice versa.  At present, mail is not permitted to traverse the boundary twice.  If this restriction were removed, GV mail originating in one constellation could be forwarded to a GV destination in another.  We believe it is possible to do this, although there are a number of unresolved issues.

File transfer: This is a problem.  Tajo is bi-lingual, so that manual techniques for moving files from an IFS to an NS file server are possible.  More elaborate proposals involve additional gateway servers which could mediate the transfer of IFS files among constellations, although not with the performance of the present system.  How much of this do people need to do?

Chat services:  Are these important outside the local area -- between constellations?  This and the absence of some of the specialized protocols would impair remote diagnosis and debugging of gateways, GV servers, and the like.  That's not all bad -- the ability to gain access to large numbers of sick machines puts a pretty heavy load on the small number of experts who know how to do it, and this would distribute the load better.

What major issue have we missed?  What are reasonable alternatives that will achieve the same goals of keeping overall costs under control while relieve the maintenance burden that has been placed on people who should be developing the next thing?

Actions -- Here's the bottom line:

1. Alto gateways are declared persona non grata beginning in January 1986.  (A more accurate statement is that constellations containing Alto gateways may find themselves in trouble with their neighbors after that time.  We plan to eliminate all Alto gateways from the Palo Alto campus very soon.	)  Those who are relying on Altos and do not have phase-out plans need to make some.

2. The present software in Dolphin gateways will also not be welcome beginning in January 1986.  Those who are relying on Dolphins and do not have phase-out plans should either make some or band together to provide ongoing maintenance and upgrades for Dolphin Pilot.

3. Of all the plans for smooth transition from the RIN to the CIN eras, one that would pull the Pup plug between constellations very soon is gaining popularity among those responsible for maintaining the RIN's facilities.  We need to know what the problems are, and how heavily people would be affected.

4. The authors of this message are willing to act as a clearinghouse to coordinate these efforts.  Let us know:
	Whether you have a serious interest in buying Dicentras;
	Whether you have programming resources (or dollars) available to support the Dolphin
		upgrade;
	What you plan to do about your Altos;
	
Let everybody know:
	What you think of the proposal to sever the Pup-side of the RIN into disjoint constellations;
	What you propose as alternatives to any of the above.

The second year's University Grants Program is now under way.  Letters were sent on March 7 to the presidents of thirty-two universities asking them to extend the invitation to the relevant department(s).  Harvard University was on the list and the letter below was sent to: Dr. D.C. Bok.

Bob Ritchie asked me to express his thanks for suggesting Harvard University.  Bob wanted to be sure you had a chance to notify your contacts at Harvard University informally if you wish so that they in turn had a chance to influence any proposals.  Bob emphasized that this is an optional exercise for you.


Dr. D.C. Bok, President
Harvard University
Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138



Dear Dr. Bok:

Enclosed is an invitation for the appropriate academic department (s) of name of University to apply for a grant of computer equipment and software for research and education, and to attend a meeting at Xerox' Palo Alto Research Center on May 9th and 10th, 1985.

The purpose of the Xerox 1985 University Grant Program is to promote research and research capabilities in specific application areas. These areas include electronic publishing, document/data management, computer aided software engineering, authoring systems, and decision support systems.  We are not excluding other applications or equipment uses which are appropriate to Xerox' technologies, but the primary focus of this program is research in these areas.

Our grant program is oriented towards computer science research; however, there may be research applications for the grant in your engineering and business schools.  Therefore, we invite you to send this invitation not only to your computer science department, but also to your engineering and business schools as appropriate.

The purpose of the May meeting is to invite researchers at your school to make proposals for this equipment.  We will describe the computing environments to be granted and outline some of our plans for extension and enhancement.  There will also be discussions and demonstrations of research projects here at PARC, including programming and design environments, and new computing hardware.

Xerox' University Grant Program made awards to twelve universities in 1984.  Their very positive response contributed to our decision to continue this important program.  We are excited about the prospect of discussing research directions here with you in May, and at the possibility of the long term relationship that may result if your school becomes a grantee.

Sincerely,


R.B. Campbell, Jr.
Vice President and Chief Technical Officer
Xerox Corporation

If you would also like to do a demo or two while at InfoMart, I'm sure Joanna could arrange that.  If you come across any interesting articles on AI (particularly ones that mention Xerox's workstations) that would be interesting for Joanna and the other Xerox staff at InfoMart, please send them to me and I will forward the articles.

If you have any exciting ideas for short, flashy demos or small expert systems for the InfoMart, send Joanna a message.  Joanna is hoping to visit PARC and AISBU soon. 

Thanks, Mary

This message is intended for those who use Personal Computer or Communicating typewriters at home or in the work environment and who have a need to access the NS network for filing and mailing operations.

In, OS 5.0 the Interactive Terminal Service has new functionality that allows dial in user to manage, view, retrieve and store files on an NS File Service as well as send and receive NS mail.

The Interactive Terminal Service or ITS allows you to do ordinary filing operation on files such as Creating, Coping, Moving, Deleting files as well as directories, listing file attributes, and listing directory contents.  ITS also allows users to reliably transfer files between NS File Services and their PC using the XModem protocol.  The XModem protocol is a file transfer protocol, developed by Ward Christensen at MIT for transfering file transparently between computers, which has been implemented in a variety of public domain programs both under CP/M and MS-DOS.

ITS is accessed by dialing into the proper phone line and connecting to the ITS using the Services 8.0 Greeter.  The Greeter is an interface which allows the incoming caller to be connected to a variety of services on the network.  Respond to the Greeter prompt with a number one for a connection to the Interactive Terminal Service, then type in the name of the Interactive Terminal Service you wish to connect to.  ITS can be access on the public servers "Venteller ITS:OSBU North:Xerox", in Palo Alto and "Mercedes:Alphaservices-ES:Xerox", in El Segundo.  Help documentation is available at this point by typing "Help".

							August 1, 1984

TOLL FREE INFORMATION NUMBER ESTABLISHED

A nationwide customer service is now available for Xerox employees or customers to obtain replies to customer inquiries that cannot be answered locally.

The service can be reached on the Intelnet System by dialing the Intelnet speed number 8-133 or on an outside telephone by dealing 1-800-334-6200.

Xerox operators will be available during regular business hours to provide information and to contact the operating unit that can best answer the customer's inquiry.  Customer calls must be returned within 24 hours.

"It is essential that all Xerox people in the U.S. operations be aware of this important customer service and this important telephone number," said executive vice president William F. Glavin, president, Business Equipment Groups. "It represents a unique opportunity to increase our level of service to all our customers and to provide our employees with an easy and fast method of obtaining information they need to accommodate our customers."

The Xerox information number can be used by employees in all Xerox units in the U.S., including Shugart, Versatec, Century Data Systems, Kurzweil, all operating units and support organizations.  It is operated by the General Services Division.

Access to the Xerox information number will be phased in on the following schedule:

Southwest and Saint Louis		August 8
Mid Atlantic and Southeast	August 15
New York and New England	August 22
Los Angeles and San Francisco	August 29

The numbers are already in use in the Midwest and North Central regions.

Subject: Forcasting paper and addenda
To: masinter.pa
cc: pedersen.pa

	There are at least two issues here:

a.) Is it worthwhile to have time-series forcasting software
floating round.

b.) If a.) then what form should it take.

	I am not a time-series man, but my basic understanding
of the problem is as follows:
	The primary goal is to predict the behavior of some quantity, based on historical information. For example,
based on the first twelve months of sales, can one estimate the total sales twelve months hence.
	One goes about this by fitting some curve to the historical data and then using that for extrapolation. Clearly, the results will depend very heavily on the curve one fits, especially since several different curves may fit the historial data very well, but all give violently different extrapolations. For example, an exponential and a quadratic might both fit well near the origin, but behave quite differently at large x.
	By fitting a curve, I mean consideration of some family of curves, parametrized by a few quantities (e.g. exp(-A x) , a single parameter family of exponentials). Assuming the historical data come from such a curve (big IF) , plus noise, the parameter(s) are estimated by some method (e.g. least squares).
The choice of family heavily influences the curve's behavior beyond the historical data (the area of interest).
	Norman's paper describes three such families, all roughly
exponential in character. He claims these families should be used in fitting sales growth data because they can be derived from some theoretical considerations, based on an idealized model of market behavior. I extract little solice from his argument. Sure, if you can present a family of curves that characterize the process under examination, then you can win big, since that family essentially  expresses a considerable amount of information about the problem. However, the chance that the curves Norman suggests really reflect something fundamental about the market place is about NIL, since the market place is very complex, and his model very idealized.
	What is really going on here is mostly black magic. You try some collection of  curves , chose the one that fits best near the historical data, and hope that it remains valid out in the future ... good luck. To have any chance of success you would need an enormous mass of historic data that fit some pattern (hopefully periodic) , so that you could say with some confidence that that pattern will  be repeated. That is not the case  here since you have a monotone increasing series, (no periodicity) and we are asked to estimate its rate of increase in the future  .... ?!
	It is too easy to dump on these people. More constructively,  it would be nice to have reliable forcasting methods, but , except in a few rare cases, the problem is very hard, perhaps impossible to make sense of. At best, you may get a sensible estimate which is VERY noisy. Any forcasting method should own up to this fact by making very prominent an estimate of error (I notice that TIA does this to some extent).

	Classical time-series analysis should be some part of any statistical system. IDL does not currently have any specialized time-series facilities, although you could use it to build up some software. I am not particularly competent in this area, so there is not too much hope in the near future of seeing time-series in IDL. Nonetheless, IDL is probably the best venue of this sort of work.

	There is some suggestion in the addenda that Xerox should participate in a project  to produce forcasting software for micro-computers. This is probably a good idea (as long as I don't have to do it) since it probably would sell well. Business men love this sort of stuff, eventhough it not too far from Voodoo. Since the target would be business men, time should be spent on a slick interface, rather then on elaborating the content (cynical ain't he).
	
	I will hold on to the papers. Tell me if you want them back.

trial basis, but nothing more.  Since Rand has registered a copyright for
REDUCE, we are now more concerned about unauthorized distribution.

Do you have any description of it other than the Reduce manual (e.g. version
3 ?)
What, if anything, did you do with the requirement for arbitrary precision
integer arithmetic?

This is a reminder that the AISBU move will begin Thursday, May 2 at 4:00 Pm.  Here is a brief description of the changes and the effect they might have on you. Please read the entire numbered list to see if you are affected.  Every effort has been made to disturb everyone as little as possible.

CHANGES:

1. Eris will move to Bldg 32 (Hanover St) and be used for the support of Interlisp-D Software Development.  This means that all of <LispCore> will remain unchanged.

2. Phylex: will move to Bldg 32 (Hanover St) and support Interlisp-D Software.  This means that all of <Lisp> (i.e. Carol, Fugue, Harmony, Intermezzo, each with their associated Library and Lispusers package files) will be online and avaliable to all of our NS users at all times. (NS Filing is avalable to Dolphin, Dandelion and Dorado users)

3. Phylum will eventually contain the necessary sysouts to support the Dolphins & Dorados in Bldg 35 (Parc).  However ...

4. Phylum is loaded nearly to capacity now and is due for a reconfiguration soon.  Until such time as Phylum is able to assume the entire support of ISL, a new machine "Eros" will be available to provide access to all public files previously available on  Eris.  Think of the 'o' in Eros as suggesting 'Old Eris' (which it just happens to be.)  This is necessary to allow Dolphin and Dorado users to get new suysouts (Harmony, Intermezzo).  

5. A new machine (Pele:) will be set up in Bldg 32 (Hanover St) for the use of all AIS people not directly involved with software development.


EFFECTS:

People will be affected in the following ways:

1. If you are an AIS person using a workstation (Dolphin, Dandelion) you can expect Brad Burns to come around and disconnect it.  You should be sure to have all of your files closed and your sysout saved.  It would help us if you leave your machine on, in Interlisp

2. If you are using Phylex: you should plan on it being taken out of service for about 4 hours, between 8:00 PM and 12:00 PM, Thursday May 2

3. If you are using Eris, you should plan on it being taken out of service Friday May 3, at 12:00 PM.  For users who have workstations avalialable, you should expect service to resume sometime late Friday evening.

4. If you are ISL, or anyone in Bldg 35, you work on a Dolphin or Dorado, and you will be planning to get a new sysout soon, you will be able to find a copy of everything you are used to finding in the directory {Eris}<lisp> on a similar directory on a new machine, {Eros}<lisp>.

5. If items  6 & 7 are anything but crystal clear to you, ignore them and contact either Cheryl James (AIS), Gary Rhoades(AI) or Jackie Guibert (ISL) before you intend to fetch a new sysout.

6. If you are AIS and moving to Bldg 32, you will need to remove Quake from DefaultPrintingHost in your site init file.

7. If you are ISL or not moving, you will need to change Directories in your personal init file (if you are using it) to point to  {Eros} rather that {Eris}

Thank you for your tolerance 

Gary

1984 PRESIDENT'S AWARDS ANNOUNCED


Xerox president and CEO David T. Kearns presented the 1984 President's Awards to 25 people from the U.S., Europe and South America.  President's Award winners received checks equivalent to a significant percentage of their annual salaries.

Citing the extraordinary accomplishments of the winners, Kearns said that their achievements represented a dedication to the pursuit of excellence that is in the very highest tradition of Xerox.

Thirteen of the awards went to individuals, while two awards were shared by three employees and one award was shared by six.  Winners and their accomplishments are:

Daniel Barbier, Rank Xerox France, Lyons, France.  Seeing that excessive paper jams in some of our high-volume copiers were occuring as a result of transport-belt slippage, Barbier developed a new transport drive shaft that solved the problem.  Belt life on these products has been doubled and paper jams have been reduced, with a marked increase in customer satisfaction. 

Michael Barkau, Business Systems Group, Fairport, NY.  Barkau developed a set of inexpensive tools and procedures for quickly calibrating the Xerox 1075's process control network, eliminating the need for for an expensive electronic retrofit.  This avoided a 1075 reliability problem which would have resulted from a delayed retrofit schedule.

Thomas Botto, BSG, Bedford, NH.  Over a two-year period, Botto devised, proposed and saw through to management approval a new Xerox unified parts-numbering system.  Once implemented worldwide, it is expected to save millions of dollars annually by increasing the productivity of our service force.

Paul Brach, Clifford Griffiths and Andrew Melnyk, Webster Research Center, Webster, NY.  This team invented and developed an innovative photoreceptor coating that makes Xerox a leader in the low-cost production of high-quality photoreceptors.  The new material and the technology for applying it have already been successfully transferred to one of our product programs.

John Seely Brown and Larry Masinter, PARC, and Beaumont Sheil, XSG Electronics Division, Palo Alto, CA.  These individuals were key contributors in developing a special computer language called Interlisp-D.  Their work was instrumental in the successful transfer of this technology into Xerox artificial intelligence workstations and in establishing Xerox as a leader in the AI product marketplace. 

James Busby, Corporate Audit, Rochester, NY; Thomas Cahill, BSG Administrative Systems, Rochester, NY; Richard Gage, BSG Customer Administration, Rochester, NY;  Philip Martin, GSD, Webster, NY; David McEneany, BSG Customer Administration, Rochester, NY; and Richard Robinson, BSG Systems Planning, Rochester, NY.  This multifunctional team replaced an outdated, inflexible order-entry and equipment-control system with state-of-the-art technology that now permits growing field activity to be managed effectively.  The new system took two years of intensive work to develop.

Hui Chang, RBG Supplies Business Unit, Webster , NY.  Chang had a pivotal role in developing extrusion as the new toner-processing technology for Xerox.  His contributions to this state-of-the-art technology have proven critical in maintaining our position as the low-cost, quality producer in the toner industry.

Robert Harwood, RBG Advanced Products and Technology, Rochester, NY.  While working on highly complex software for an advanced C/D product, Harwood was asked to shift his attention to an emergency software redesign on a different one.  By working evenings and weekends, he was able to complete both projects in superior fashion and avoid any delay on his original assignment.

John Henville-Shannon, XSG Printing Systems Division, El Segundo, CA.  When customer complaints about dirt emission from the Xerox 9700 electronic printing system threatened to reduce the competitiveness of this highly successful product, Henville-Shannon volunteered to lead a team to tackle the problem.  The solution proved applicable nationally to the whole product line, increasing customer satisfaction with our electronic printing systems.

Karl Mueller, RMG New Build Operations, Webster, NY.  In the course of his work as an assembler, Mueller identified and corrected several defects in the design and tooling for the Xerox 1035 copier.  Respected by both engineering and operations management for his initiative, judgment and technical skills, he has contributed greatly to the 1035's success.

Thomas O'Connor, Real Estate and General Services Division, Stamford, CT.  After O'Connor discovered a multi-million-dollar opportunity to increase cash income from a property sale/leaseback, the IRS issued a last-minute change in tax law that would nullify the gain if the transaction was not completed in 1984.  O'Connor led a marathon negotiating session that reached an agreement in the last two work days of the year, resulting in a cash intake many times the amount that would otherwise have been forfeited.

Sedat Ozmen, Xerox de Brasil, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Ozmen's alertness to an opportunity allowed by Brazilian tax law led to his idea of converting a portion of XBRA debt into government equity.  By successfully negotiating this complex transaction with the Brazilian Central Bank and government authorities, Ozmen achieved a substantial positive cash flow for the company.

Richard Palmer, Corporate Treasury, Stamford, CT.  Working in an area of great unpredictability, Palmer devised a number of innovative ways to manage the company's foreign currency exposure.  Through his insight and analytical ability, these currency strategies have saved Xerox millions of dollars.

Deborah Reich, BSG New York Region, New York, NY.  Reich pioneered the  creation of a unique Memorywriter Support Center as a way of addressing sales shortfalls in early 1983.  Visited by nearly 10,000 people since it opened, the information center has helped the NY region move from 10th place nationally in Memorywriter sales to first place in 1984 and has become a model for other major cities.

Harry Rosenfeld, RBG Advanced Products and Technology, Webster, NY.  As the company's recognized expert in value analysis, a technique for evaluating the effectiveness of engineering designs, Rosenfeld has uniquely contributed to RBG's accomplishments in achieving cost reductions, greater product dependability and improved product performance.  Because of his leadership and commitment, VA is widely accepted and used with the Xerox engineering community.

Francois Sagnard, Rank Xerox France, Paris, France.  Sagnard developed an inexpensive automatic test system for printed circuit boards used in Xerox products.  Now patented, his system allows unskilled operators to be more productive in spotting and repairing defective electronic and microprocessor circuits.

Yes, I forgot the PVAR_^'s, hiding off in a completely different part of the opcode space.  So with that it becomes

357 PVAR_'s and PVAR_^'s turned into 345 STORE.N's and 199 POP's.

I count only 9 free opcodes in the current instruction set; hence, I'm inclined against introducing one-byte versions COPY2, STORE2 etc.  Though if we start to feel squeezed, there are some opcodes on the list that are placeholders we've changed our minds about (DOCOLLECT, ENDCOLLECT), as well as opcodes that are obvious candidates for merging into an alpha-byte dispatch of the MISC1, MISC2 etc sort (ASSOC, LISTGET, DRAWLINE, READPRINTERPORT, WRITEPRINTERPORT, GCSCAN1, GCSCAN2).

I agree with turning it off if you can't come up with a reasonable way to distinguish the good and bad cases.

Bob, 
I received the following info from our 8000-support. He got it from XSIS in Pasadena.!!!!  I would appreciate similar kind of info directly from You and maybe also info about 1108 marketing experiences and plans. Swedish customers hear from US customers about Xerox marketing , they call me to find out but as I never hear anything from XSIS,  I can do nothing  about it.
Competition is pushing hard on our existing customers claiming they have  Common Lisp ( customer need due  to semantics in language), Unix, better transport vehicles, faster HW ( 32 bit VLSI and color ) and maybe also prolog.
As I have failed to get any info out of Pasadena myself, I ask You to use Your channels to get some info from them.
I understand that a large number of microVAXes will be installed in Europe. When will the DEQNA-supported SW be available?
Expect to get orders for 2 Dandetigers, 2-3 1.5 MB 1108:s plus a fileserver before end June.
Here is the smalltalk message:
The Smalltalk Group of the XSIS Vista Laboratory is currently engineering the Dandelion implementation of Smalltalk-80 developed at PARC to run on the 1108X AI Workstation (known internally as the DandeTiger), a 3.5 MByte, 12K control store configuration of the Dandelion marketed by the AISBU. This project, officially begun in September of last year, is a joint effort between Fuji Xerox and XSIS. Fuji Xerox is providing approximately half of the resources, including 2 full-time engineers resident in Pasadena.

Development is scheduled for completion in late September of this year. XSIS has not made any product announcements and there are no formal product plans at this time. However, 16 1108X Smalltalk-80 workstations were recently installed at a customer site for running custom Smalltalk-80 application software developed by XSIS. 1108X Smalltalk-80 has also been used in 3 customer training courses and will be demonstrated at SIGPLAN 85 in Seattle, Washington, on June 25-29. We would like to make the software available to the University Grants participants at an appropriate time in the future, but there is still a lot of work to do before it is ready for wide distribution.

XSIS recently provided a demonstration version of The Analyst to Tony Goodman of Rank Xerox in Australia. Below is a description of The Analyst:

	The Xerox Analyst-85 Workstation System is the most sophisticated
	Smalltalk-based software system developed to date. The Analyst-85 is an
	integrated set of application packages that provides a wide range of
	information analysis capabilities. These packages are used by professional
	analysts as tools in a working environment that can be customized to
	individual needs, and also by programmers as a foundation for the
	development of sophisticated interactive applications. Packages include the
	Information Center, Maps and Images, Business Graphics, Spreadsheets,
	Outlines, Organization Charts, Expert System Shell, Personal Data Base
	Management, Printing, On-Line Atlas, Report Generation, Clocks,
	Calendars, and Terminal Emulation.

Our Smalltalk-80 system development tasks, in particular the 1108X Smalltalk-80 project, are undertaken to provide a suitable delivery vehicle for our Smalltalk-80 applications. A secondary goal is to develop a state-of-the-art Smalltalk-80 programming environment for standard Xerox workstations.

I recommend that you inform Uppsala University that XSIS is engineering 1108X Smalltalk-80, that it has not yet been announced as a product, and that it may be generally available late this year or early next year. We may consider delivering prototype versions of the implementation to selected beta-test sites, and/or providing the system without support before it becomes an official product.

Dear Bob:
Uppsala are waiting for the DandeTiger board and 12 K option. When will they get it? They have asked me about Smalltalk for their 1108. A perfect Betatest in my opinion.

I also received interesting info about UNIX.
Here it is:

XNS on Unix--A combination of the University of Maryland, Cornell University, and the Xerox Webster Research Center have XNS up and running on Unix. It is implemented inside the operating system kernal. That means your customer would need a strong kernal hacker to fit it into his system.

So far, internetwork routing, printing and the GAP protocol have been implemented, not Filing. A Courier compiler was written by Cornell, so new applications between  InterLisp, Suns, and Vaxes should be possible.

People at Cornell use the Xerox 8044 printer for their Unix output through the ditroff Unix system.

There is also a chance for XNS protocols to be included in the new release of Berkeley Unix, 4.3.
Availability: I don't know. 

Again Bob:
The Berkely 4.2 is running fairly good at Uppsala.They will be more than happy to pay for an XNS-supported Unix*start*

Larry,


I would not disagree with what you say about the energies that Catton, Gittins & Butler have put into AIL.  As far as Glaister is concerned, he would very much like to see AIL less closely coupled, due to the fact that he sees really large market opportunities ahead.  

I would hate to stifle the drive and initiative of Butler and Co. through a cumbersome RX organisation, however, I think that if you meet Martin Cooper you will realise that we have the possible beginnings of a strong organistion in RX.  As far as AIL is concerned, I have personally thought for a long time that the set up was ill conceived and not really in Xerox's long term interest.

I do not know what the AIL mail problem is.  I am aware that in the future they are likely to be cut off the Internet and allowed on through the mail gateway only.  I suspect that they do not have resources in AIL to maintain their internet connection (having seen there latest message then I know that is the case..."AILSupport:ih:ail  A fictitious support person."....), of course the problem could be in RX at Bushey ...or Webster.

I do not think that it will be possible for for Martin Cooper to go to Pasadena on this visit, although if he has the time then he should try to make it.

Thanks for your comments and help.

I wholeheartedly support your attempt to get more technical knowledge inside RX of what Interlisp-D is all about. 

I'm usually an opinionated fellow, and I'll pass along some opinions...

I've spent some time with AIL and a number of UK users. If AIL is making good money, its probably because of the large amount of time and energy they've invested in the product, understanding it, hiring and training a professional support staff. I've seen Catton & Gittins & Butler put in long days and nights and weekends.... 

Frankly, I've not much in the way of investment on RX's part; Glaister seems to mainly be working alone in HQ, and the number of folks committed to AI marketing, support, etc. in the OpCos for all of Europe seems to be less than a handful. (Less than total AIL staff, for example.)

I've seen that there's been real problems with AIL's support for the OpCos. AIL doesn't seem to go out of their way to push support upon the European OpCos, and the value they add for the OpCos may not match the cost. However, I've looked for and not seen many examples of OpCo's urgently requesting or demanding additional support. As far as I can tell, there's Bremander and Haggstrom in Sweden, a few folks in France, and nobody home anywhere else.  I'm reluctant to generalize about "support to the OpCos" when it doesn't seem like there's anyone there to support. 

On the Electronic Mail front... mail to and from AIL has been particularly unreliable as of late. I don't think the problems are on their end. I send mail, and three days later I get a return notice.  Do you know what might be happening here? 

I've had direct mail with Martin Cooper... I'll see if I can schedule him in with the appropriate folks. Mary Hausladen generally knows the most about Loops & gives Loops demos; I can spend some additional time with him. He probably should spend some time in Pasadena (Southern California) talking to the customer support group if European support is an issue.

Larry,

I agree that in the UK AIL does appear to do a good job of supporting customers, however, I am told that any money to be made is made by AIL and very little by RX (even less by Xerox). The people I have talked to in the Op Cos get poor support from AIL and have to pay an arm and two legs for it.  

There certainly is a need for marketing support in Europe but if we are to make a business of Interlisp in Europe then we might as well start by getting some technical knowledge inside RX of what it is all about.  So we can both talk and demonstrate the products to Senior Management.

As far as "good electronic mail communication between local customer support and U.S." is concerned, then there is a lot of wrk to be done.  We do currently have many of the Op Cos connected to the Internet, but I am afraid that the bandwidths are not adequatye, and they have not learnt that real support is required to keep an adequate service.  We are working on that and there is a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel.

Thanks for offering to meet Martin Cooper, I would not expect him to talk about support costs, but rather to get a technical overview of what you are doing.  I will ask Martin to contact you directly about the time of your meeting.  Could I also ask you to organise a demo of Loops with the appropriate person?

Larry,


I would not disagree with what you say about the energies that Catton, Gittins & Butler have put into AIL.  As far as Glaister is concerned, he would very much like to see AIL less closely coupled, due to the fact that he sees really large market opportunities ahead.  

I would hate to stifle the drive and initiative of Butler and Co. through a cumbersome RX organisation, however, I think that if you meet Martin Cooper you will realise that we have the possible beginnings of a strong organistion in RX.  As far as AIL is concerned, I have personally thought for a long time that the set up was ill conceived and not really in Xerox's long term interest.

I do not know what the AIL mail problem is.  I am aware that in the future they are likely to be cut off the Internet and allowed on through the mail gateway only.  I suspect that they do not have resources in AIL to maintain their internet connection (having seen there latest message then I know that is the case..."AILSupport:ih:ail  A fictitious support person."....), of course the problem could be in RX at Bushey ...or Webster.

I'm not an expert on either Loops or support costs, but I'll be happy to talk to Martin Cooper. 

I think that AIL has been doing a very good job of supporting UK customers, and that it will be hard to replace them there.

The problems in the rest of Europe aren't primarily in the areas of centralized Interlisp-D software support... I'd put "marketing support" and "good electronic mail communication between local customer support and U.S." much higher.

Larry,

We met some time ago when you visited Welwyn Hall.  In case you do not recall I manage a group called SDD-RX and look after the OSD products from a European standpoint.  In addition we have a 10 person MESA group developing applications and services software for RX.  Martin Gittins used to be a member of my group before he left for AIL.

I have been asked by RX IHQ to put together a proposal for supporting INTERLISP software in Europe starting in fiscal 1986 (Nov 85 - Oct 86).  This support would be independent of AIL and indeed at present RX would prefer that AIL did not know about the proposal.

Martin Cooper one of my Developers will be over on the West Coast next week for an Interscript conference.  I would apprecite it if you could find time next Friday to talk to him, to demonstrate LOOPS and tell him about your future plans.

Please let me know if Friday is suitable and if so your preferred time.

Regards

John

As part of moving from IFS servers to product file servers, the <Services> and <Services - Public> directories will be moving.  The changes that will be made are described below.  Once the changes have been effected, I will send another message just prior to the disappearance of the obsolete directories.  If these changes will cause any problems, please contact me.

The changes will be as follows:

[Iris]<Services> will disappear.

I have installed Gold Hill Computers "Golden Common Lisp" on the PC-AT (downstairs in the library) on the directory C:\GCLISP.  In order to use it, make sure you are in that directory, and run GCLISP. IE:

C:<RET>
CD \GCLISP<RET>
GCLISP<RET>

This will put you at the top-level.  CTRL-E puts you in the GMACS editor. (similar subset of EMACS). Or you can enter (ED 'file). Function key 9 or 10 writes the file, and I believe Function key 1 exits the editor back to the interpretor. Then (LOAD 'file). There is no compiler.

From the interpretor ALT-E puts you in a slide show type tutorial.

Unfortunetly, I have not been able to install it on our  1186 PC Emulation  RIgid DIsk. I believe this is because of the way the copy protection works on their distribution floppies. This may be a blessing in disquise since it won`t let our customers use it.  Gary Rhoades is trying to get an unprotected copy for us.  Gary also has the manual if you want to borrow it.
