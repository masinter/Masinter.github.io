<p><em>2.5 Intercultural Skills - Background:  People from many different cultures and backgrounds participate in the IETF.  Many have English as a second language, and the diverse backgrounds mean that  there are numerous sets of mores for public behavior in the IETF. How should  the IETF improve its handling of intercultural matters?  Please provide specific examples of problems  you have seen. Additionally, please indicate any skills or experience that you  have that you think are relevant to helping the IETF better handle such issues  in the future.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>There are two distinct issues here. The  first one is a matter of accessibility of proceedings to all participants. The  second is dealing with unpleasant or unexpected behavior. The best approaches  to these issues are different:</em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>For the first issue:<br>
  The IETF/IAOC should focus on improving the  technical means of participation (projected real-time transcripts, simultaneous  translation supported, training for participants as well as chairs, etc. Steps  can be taken to help non-native speakers understand and participate in the  work, and to reduce the fire hose of mailing list traffic (which can act as an  effective &ldquo;denial of service&rdquo;).  Many of  the ideas for improvement would help ALL participants engage in a more  deliberative discussion. The limits here are budget and management of the  effectiveness of various potential solutions. Most of the technology  investigations done to date have been ad-hoc and poorly supported.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The &ldquo;community&rdquo; to focus on is those who  represent the Internet engineering community. Dealing with language, culture,  geographic, gender, ethnic, nationality diversity, should all be focused on  encouraging technically-engaged participation. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Expertise is not confined to particular geographic  areas, and the best minds are just as likely not at institutions that can fund  frequent travel. Fortunately, collaborative technology is growing in power and  usability, including issue trackers, version management tools, speech-to-text,  machine translation aids, and so forth.   It should be a goal to increase the reality of the proposition that  attending IETF meetings is unnecessary for full participation, not just through  remote participation in meetings. Note that other SDOs provide simultaneous translation.  Benchmarking against other SDOs and an evaluation of the effectiveness of  process enhancements on standards-making is called for.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>In addition, there is the matter of  increasing diversity of participation in IETF management positions (chairs, IESG,  IAB)  by engineers from outside the G8  countries; participation in management is primarily a matter of focusing  mentoring and outreach.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Specific examples, experience, skills: I&rsquo;ve  frequently observed, in IETF meetings, rapid-fire conversations which are  barely comprehensible even to someone fluent in English. IETF remote  participation support is haphazard, difficult to set up, and not readily usable  by chairs, note takers, meeting participants. I&rsquo;ve been in working groups where  flurries of discussion on minor points have swamped the mailbox any  less-than-fulltime participants.   Network-mediated communication has been a long-term research interest,  and I have experience with a wide range of experimental and commercial systems,  both good and bad.  In the 90s, I gave  numerous tutorials (some with simultaneous translation) to audiences of  non-native speakers and took speaker training.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>For the second issue: <br>
  Dealing with difficult participants and  behavior is problematic, because of the openness of the IETF process.   However, my perception is that most  difficult behavior has been manageable by working group chair with occasional  help from their AD. IETF will have difficulty relying on authority to enforce  rules of behavior. Rather, it is the needs of the community – working group  members, observers, and the IETF as a whole, to call out and censure  inappropriate behavior, and to promote rules of conduct.  </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Specific examples, experience, skills: The  HTTP working group was especially contentious, and there were times when  forceful feedback was necessary to remind participants of the common good of  standards and the inappropriateness of ad hominem remarks.  The most egregious ad hominem attacks I&rsquo;ve  personally experienced have occurred outside the IETF (in W3C HTML).  A sense of humor and a better insight into  the nature of standards goes a long way toward being able to deal with  unpleasant behavior. </strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p><em>2.6 If you are an incumbent IAB member, what  aspects of your own work do you think you could improve to become a better IAB  member?</em></p>
<p>N/A</p>
<p><em>2.7 If there is any other information you  wish the NOMCOM to have, of any type that might personally identify you, please  share it here or in Section 11 below, and not elsewhere in the questionnaire.  This question is a good place to summarize why you personally are qualified for  and should receive strong consideration for the position.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>I have experience and expertise to provide a  unique contribution to the  IAB.  I understand and respect IETF traditions, but  I am not bound by them. I have long and broad experience in IETF, and  I also bring significant standards experience  with Internet standards outside the IETF, and in particular with W3C; I am one  of a handful of people who have regularly participated in both IETF and W3C  meetings. </em></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>My tenure in the W3C TAG gives me a  different architectural experience and perspective.</strong></em><br>
  <br>
  =============================================================</p>
<p><em>3. IETF Discuss the ways you think the IETF is  fulfilling its purpose and the ways it needs to improve.</em></p>
<p><strong>The IETF&rsquo;s core mission and basic principles  are sound, and the IETF has been quite successful in developing the Internet,  while insuring an open process and limiting intellectual property constraints.  On the other hand, IETF has often failed to attract or retain the essential  participation of some of the most important stakeholders and Internet uses;  some working groups have produced specs which are not adopted by industry, fail  to make progress or just take too long. </strong></p>
<p><strong>In particular, processes and infrastructure  are woefully behind the state of the art. Especially at the applications layer,  the IETF has fallen far behind.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a voluntary standards organization (in  that IETF specs alone do not carry legal weight), IETF needs to more clearly  understand its audience ( implementors, reviewers, purchasers), insure their  effective participation, and reduce friction and process bottlenecks.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IETF currently does not invest nearly  enough in outreach and promotion.  The  rest of the world has discovered the power of the Internet for building and  managing communities and supporting collaboration; it&rsquo;s time for the IETF to  move forward much more rapidly. </strong></p>
<p><em>3.2 Discuss your views on the nature and  practice of IETF liaisons, including any changes you would like to see.</em></p>
<p><strong>There is a tendency to treat other SDOs and  consortia as separate groups, with liaisons functioning as ambassadors, to be  called in when problems are detected and often too late to fix.  But often these other groups consist of  (often different) representatives from the *same* companies and groups.  Some part of liaison coordination should be  the responsibility of working group chairs and document editors at the working  group level.  Liaison needs to  be pro-active and not reactive. Liaison  coordination should be more part of the process – for example, that determining  &ldquo;rough consensus&rdquo; explicitly solicit opinions of working groups of other SDOs  considering referencing IETF standards; encourage joint meetings with  participants of liaison working groups, and so forth.</strong></p>
<p><em>4. IAB</em></p>
<p><em>Background: The summary of desired expertise  for IAB positions is available at:<br>
  <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/nomcom/2013/expertise">https://datatracker.ietf.org/nomcom/2013/expertise</a> .</em></p>
<p><em>4.1 What are your views on the description,  especially concerning the different roles for an IAB member and the time  commitments deemed necessary to fulfill those roles?</em></p>
<p><strong>As described, the responsibilities of the  IAB would seem to greatly exceed what can be accomplished with the total  manpower available from IAB members collectively. However, the IAB web site (<a href="http://www.iab.org/">http://www.iab.org/</a>)  gives a better picture of actual IAB activities.</strong></p>
<p>4.2 What should be the impact of the IAB,  internal and external to the IETF? What is currently going well and what needs  improvement? What is your long term vision for the IAB? What needs to happen,  to achieve these goals and what are the priorities for them?</p>
<p><strong>No other group is chartered to steer the  long-term strategy for Internet development, and this should be the primary IAB  focus. More resources for development, education and outreach on Internet  Architecture would be helpful. While currently IAB has successfully published  RFCs on important strategic architectural considerations, in many cases, this  should be the start of outreach activity, not the end.  To lead, the IAB needs to reach a wide  audience, from Internet developers to government regulators, and not just Area  Directors and those working group chairs who manage to watch the RFC stream. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The stable functioning of the Internet has  become a crucial underpinning of the global economy and society, and it is at  risk, from both unintentional side-effects as well as malicious attack. Defense  against both requires an architectural vision that balances features against  resilience in an architectural way.</strong></p>
<p>4.3 What is your understanding of  &quot;architecture&quot; when referring to IETF work? How is it different from  protocol work? What areas of Internet architecture need improvement and how  should that be achieved? What is the role and utility of architecture in IETF  activities? </p>
<p><strong>I use the term &ldquo;architecture&rdquo; for any system  to mean the ways in which a system can be divided into parts, each with one or  more identified functions, and  the set  of interfaces  (APIs, protocols,  languages, data formats, connectors) that connect these parts. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Internet is just a distributed system  composed of many parts – it is unique and uniquely valuable in that there is  only one Internet on the planet. The architecture of the Internet evolves;  traditionally, IETF has focused on protocol interfaces with an occasional dip  into common data formats and (even less frequently) languages.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unfortunately, the documented parts of the  actual Internet architecture represent only an incomplete fraction of what is  actually deployed.  Within IETF  activities, the role of architecture is to document how the pieces fit  together, to allow for predictive understanding of the impact of protocol  changes on performance under load, security, reliability, and other qualities.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ideally, a clear understanding of Internet  architecture would improve the quality of IETF work.</strong></p>
<p><em>4.4 What abilities would you bring to the  IAB compared to the expertise currently available on it? What are your key  strengths (in general, leaving specific types of experience to your answers in  Section 2)?</em></p>
<p><strong>I bring unique experience in key areas of  Internet use that are currently poorly represented in IETF management. I  understand the business aspect of standardization and commercial motivation for  standards participation and standards processes. I have deep experience not  only in IETF but also other standardization organizations, and have studied and  helped develop standards processes.</strong></p>
<p><em>4.5 What are your views on the ongoing IAB  programs in general and on the specific programs? In particular, how do you see  confidentiality issues e.g. sharing of information to non-IAB members, and do  you see needs for improvements to any of the current practices related to IAB  programs?</em></p>
<p><strong>The Programs   of the IAB seem haphazard and poorly motivated – why these and not  others? Every activity needs metrics of success and milestones of  accomplishment tied to those. I have no problems with IAB members exercising  judgment as to what should be or remain confidential; unfortunately, we live in  a world dominated by rumor and social media. But confidentiality should be  time-limited in a way that corresponds to the risks associated with disclosure.</strong></p>
<p><em>4.6 What are your views of developing the  skills and talent of others so that there is a pipeline into the IAB and into  the leadership roles within the IAB (IAB Chair, directors of programs, etc.)</em></p>
<p><strong>IAB members should be experienced enough to  be capable of assuming leadership roles. Mentoring and pairing of leadership  roles (rotating co-chair, assistant to director of programs) would be one way  of developing talent. </strong></p>
<p><em>5. MANAGEMENT AND SOFT SKILLS </em><em>5.1 How do you use analysis, planning and  inter-personal skills in working with others, including managing them?</em></p>
<p><strong>I believe leadership is more important than  management in a volunteer organization such as the IETF. Management has  authority and control. Leadership involves persuasion and inspiration. My  experiences as project lead and manager have primarily been with senior  researchers and developers, in a situation where technical competence, not  management authority, inspires confidence in others and willingness to follow.  People participate in IETF for a reason – some for the pleasure of contributing  technology to something that matters in the world, some for personal credit,  some to help insure that their products have a market advantage. The first  requirement for leadership is to understand and appeal to the motives of those  led. </strong></p>
<p><em>5.2 What are your personal strengths in  general that would allow you to contribute to the communications and management  aspects of serving on the IAB? </em></p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;m articulate, inquisitive, innovative, and  persistent, open-minded, experienced.</strong></p>
<p>Please use Section 2 to comment on specific  experience that would allow you to contribute to these aspects, and comment  here only on general strengths.</p>
<p><em>6. IRTF. 
  What is your view of the IRTF's role with  respect to the IETF, IAB and the Internet?</em></p>
<p><strong>Frankly, I don&rsquo;t understand why the IRTF is  an IAB or IETF program, except that many in IRTF also attend IETF meetings, and  some IRTF research results might be transferred to IETF.  Research management is hard because it tends  to become politicized; organizations tend to support research by those they  know, rather than by the most important and most likely successful topics .  Detecting this bias and correcting for it is difficult.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Further, while the IAB notes it has an  important role with IRTF, it&rsquo;s indicative the IRTF&rsquo;s web page scarcely mentions  the IAB. </strong></p>
<p><em>7. INTERNET GOVERNANCE<br>
  7.1 Discuss your understanding of the  activities and goals that are covered by the term Internet Governance in  general terms. </em></p>
<p><strong>The term &ldquo;Internet Governance&rdquo; is primarily  used to refer to the management of the lower layers of the Internet  infrastructure: the social, economic, regulatory aspects of developing and  operating the Internet. </strong></p>
<p>7.2 Please describe Internet Governance  issues for which you think the IAB should have a position during your term.</p>
<p><strong>I think the Governance issues of the IAB  should focus on those aspects for which pending legislative and regulatory  action in various jurisdictions threatens the Internet architecture. The IAB  should also begin to plan for future positioning by being actively involved in  positioning the IAB and the IETF as responsible and responsive participants in  the massively connected world.</strong></p>
<p><em>8. APPEALS<br>
  Background: Section 6.5 of RFC 2026  describes a process of &quot;open review and discussion&quot; used to resolve  disputes or appeal decisions that cannot be resolved through the ordinary  process. The way in which appeals have been handled has varied significantly  over time. At some point in the past, appeals have been discussed in open  plenary with the community asked to give input during the appeals process. In  more recent years, the IESG and IAB have handled appeals in executive session,  even asking liaisons from other organizations to leave. <br>
  How should IETF leadership approach the  dispute resolution/appeal? Should any changes be made, such as to the  transparency of the process? How can appeals be handled to lessen their being  adversarial? </em></p>
<p><strong>There have been few enough appeals that I  don&rsquo;t have a strong opinion; I would need to review the appeals that were  handled in executive session rather than publicly. I imagine there might be  some concerns about liability or other kinds of pressure on vulnerable decision  makers, for example.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Appeals *are* adversarial, and I am not in  favor of trying to hide that. The primary goal should be to minimize the  dominance of financial or political or brand advantage over technical  merit.  </strong></p>
<p><em>9. TIME COMMITMENT</em></p>
<p><em>Background: IAB members are responsible for  various activities including regular attendance at IAB teleconferences and  attendance in person to IETF meetings and IAB workshops. The time commitment in  &quot;normal weeks&quot; (i.e., those not containing IETF meetings, retreats,  or workshops) is typically one to three days a week or more for IAB members  that are fully engaged.</em></p>
<p><em>Are you willing and able to commit your time  to complete IAB tasks such as to follow the IAB, IRTF and IETF discussions on a  regular basis?</em></p>
<p><strong>yes</strong></p>
<p><em>END OF SECTION: NO PERSONAL IDENTIFYING  INFORMATION<br>
  ============================================================= <br>
  NOT FOR CONFIRMING BODY </em></p>
<p><em>The answer to the following question will  not be shared with the confirming body (the ISOC Board). This section may  include personal identifying information.</em></p>
<p><em>10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</em></p>
<p><em>Is there any information you wish to share  with the Nominating Committee that you do not wish to have shared with the ISOC  Board? This may include additional details about employment or work time  issues. It may include opinions or comments about individuals on the various  bodies involved in leading the IETF activities. It may include opinions about  the direction of working groups, areas, or leadership bodies. These comments  may also include elaborations on any of your above answers, if there are  further aspects you would like to mention that you do not want shared with the  ISOC Board.</em></p>
<p>while at W3C, to encourage better IETF  coordination – there isn&rsquo;t a separate IETF Web and W3C Web. I would hope to  continue to work that relationship from the IETF side.</p>
<p>The IETF and W3C (and many of the other  established SDOs) are under attack as being slow-moving, old-boy, insider  groups dominated by  academic purists.  The IETF and IAB need to work to address the issues raised by outreach, but  also listening more and incorporating feedback, engaging in non-contentious  activities in coordination with potential allies and new audiences. In general  we should be more aware that the industry and market are changing and that are  willing to lead the change.<br>
