<h1>Position Paper: Device Independence Workshop on Delivery Context<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/2002-03-05-di-workshop.html"></a></h1>

<a href="https://larrymasinter.net">Larry Masinter</a>, <a href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe Systems Incorporated</a></h2>



<h2>Background</h2>



Adobe Systems Incorporated is a leading provider of products and

services in support of <a href=

"http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pressmaterials/networkpublishing/main.html"

>network publishing</a>: "Publish anything, anywhere, on any device."





<p> Adobe has been a leader in defining industry standard for

device-independent representations, as the developer of Postscript,

PDF and as a leader in many other industry standards.



<p> Adobe has significant experience in the area of Delivery

Context. For example, <a

href="http://partners.adobe.com/asn/developer/pdfs/tn/5003.PPD_Spec_v4.3.pdf">Postscript

Printer Description files</a> include detailed information about

printer capabilities and characteristics. To support accurate color

reproduction, <a

href="http://www.adobe.com/support/techdocs/c9fe.htm">several

technologies</a> are involved in

describing the delivery context for color.



<p> In the area of content description, Adobe has developed and

released an open source implementation of its <a

href="http://www.adobe.com/products/xmp/main.html">eXtensible Metadata

Platform (XMP)</a>, based on RDF, which may include content

characterizations.  



<h2>Terminology</h2>



It may be helpful to define terminology. <i>Author</i>,

<i>publisher</i>, <i>distributor</i> and <i>viewer</i> are typically

roles for people and organizations. <i>Sender</i>, <i>intermediary</i>

and <i>receiver</i> are roles in the network architecture.  The

<i>application</i> is <i>delivery</i> of <i>content</i> from the

sender to the receiver. Intermediaries act as <i>agents</i> that

receive content (acting as a receiver) and subsequently send it toward

its ultimate destination (acting as a sender), while performing some

value-added service such as caching or content <i>adaptation</i>.



<p>

<i>Delivery context</i> includes information about the receiver's

<i>capabilities</i>, <i>characteristics</i> and <i>preferences</i>, as

seen by or communicated to the sender (and possibly modified

by intermediaries), and <i>content descriptions</i> within or

associated with the content about the content itself. Architecturally,

this contextual information can be used in several ways, including:



<dl>

  <dt> <i>Content adaptation</i>

  <dd>The sender determines the

  capabilities, characteristics or preferences (CCPs) of the

  receiver or and adapts the content for the context.



  <dt> 

<i> Content selection</i>

         <dd>An agent (sender, receiver or intermediary)

  chooses among available variants for transmission (based on

  matching receiver CCPs with content attributes).



 <dt> 

<i> Adaptive content 	</i> <dd> 

The content itself contains scripted or

  descriptive content alternatives.

</ul>

</dl>



<h2>Position Statement</h2>



When possible, it is far preferable to use a consistent

device-independent content format as the primary carrier of

content. Device independent representations have extraordinary

advantages, both technically (e.g., better caching, reliability,

ability to use digital signatures to verify authenticity) and

operationally (minimizes necessary infrastructure to provide

transformations, update versions of deployed software, maintenance of

content adaptation, profile recognition, etc.)



In situations where content adaptation is necessary,

the following principles apply:

<dl>

  <dt> <b>Late adaptation, if at all</b>

  <dd> 



<p>

  If it is necessary to provide content adaptation, because of

  limitations of bandwidth or device computational power, the

  adaptation should happen as late in the process as possible.

  If necessary, device-independent formats should be enhanced

  to provide hints for adaptation.

</p></dd>

  <dt> 

<b> Uniform vocabulary</b></dt>

  <dd> 

<p>  We are not served well by specialized vocabularies devised

  for single applications. Ultimately, content authors will

  want broader contexts of delivery than whatever they're using

  now; makers of software for receivers will want to adapt

  or interpret a wide variety of content.</p><p>

       It is not acceptable to let each implementation and

       application choose its own vocabulary. Interoperability

       suffers, and software complexity increases. Common

       concepts should be expressed in common ways across

       the entire spectrum of applications.

</p></dd>



  <dt> <b>Large-granularity features are better</b>

  <dd> 

<p>  The temptation to do fine-granularity negotiation between sender

  and receiver is high, but ultimately, no one is served well by it.

  Adapting content exactly for the color gamut of the receiver

  or for the details of the font repertoire may be necessary, but

  as a community the pressure should be on the receivers to adopt

  complete solutions or, miniminally, have clear predetermined fallbacks.

  The general experience has been that fine-grained

  detailed content adaptation is problematic and difficult to support

  and sustain.</p></dd>

<h2>Personal History</h2>



<p>I have been involved in the development of web standards since

nearly the beginning of the web, contributing to the development of

the fundamental standards underlying the web.  I have worked in the

area of content negotiation and content adaptation even longer;

beginning in the late 1980's with a content management and adaptation

system called "System 33"; System 33 was influential in the

development of content negotiation in the web architecture (see <a

href="http://www.w3.org/Conferences/IETF92/WWX_BOF_mins.html">this

1992 report</a>, for example). Among other work, I helped establish

the <a

href="http://www.imc.org/ietf-medfree/index.html">CONNEG

work</a> within IETF (as a spin-off of work in the HTTP working

group), and contributed to it and related standards.
