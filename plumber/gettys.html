<p>Now that http:// is not only ubiquitous but hip, the World Wide Web's HTTP

accounts for 70 percent of Internet traffic. <img alt="Jim Gettys holding a

Sure, be grateful for this Internet plumbing that downloads your many wonderful

Web pages, but be aware that in doing so, HTTP generates far too many

unnecessary Internet packets. HTTP is one of the main reasons you often have to

use your Web browser's prominent Stop button. HTTP 1.0 is seriously bogging the

Internet down. UUNet's Mike O'Dell, last year's winner, refers to the currently

deployed 1.0 version of HTTP as &quot;the Internet's bug number one.&quot;

O'Dell has high praise for this year's Internet Plumber of the Year, Jim Gettys, for

his work on the coming 1.1 version of HTTP, which is now in its final rounds of

standardization, implementation, and deployment.</p>


<h3>Sharing the credit</h3>

<p>Jim Gettys wouldn't at first let <i>InfoWorld</i> give him our 1997 Internet

Plumber of the Year. I had to agree to credit the whole team working on

HTTP/1.1. Then Gettys had a hard time limiting the list of HTTP/1.1 team members and is

clearly bent on sharing credit, which has to be one of the secrets of his

	continuing success.</p>

<p>According to Gettys, big contributors to HTTP/1.1 include Roy Fielding, at

the University of California at Irvine, for putting the initial proposal

together; Jeff Mogul, at Digital Equipment's Western Research Lab, for arguing

persistent connections and caching; Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, at the World Wide

Web Consortium (W3C), for serious design work and early implementations; Paul

Leach, at Microsoft, for widespread contributions; Dave Kristol, at Lucent, for

dealing with the cookie mess; and John Franks for digest authentication.</p>

<p>Larry Massinter at the

Xerox Palo Alto Research Center chairs the HTTP/1.1 working group of the

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF at <a href="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</a>).

When I asked Massinter what he thought about <i>InfoWorld</i> recognizing Gettys, he quipped, &quot;I'm

happy to be the plumber's helper.&quot;</p>

<p>Gettys says there are many more HTTP/1.1 contributors, but I had to cut the

list off at that point. If you've been left out, sorry -- it's my fault, and

you're in good company with W3C's Tim Berners-Lee, also an HTTP/1.1 contributor

and, by the way, the inventor of the Web.</p>

	<h3>So who is Jim Gettys, and what is HTTP/1.1?</h3>

<p>Gettys is employed by Digital, which is reported to be considering him for

promotion in its Industry Standards and Consortia activity -- hope this award

helps, Jim. For years, Gettys has been a visiting scientist at W3C at

Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT's) Laboratory for Computer Science.

Of course, Gettys has his own Web pages at <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Gettys">http://www.w3.org/People/Gettys</a>.</p>

<p>Before, Gettys was best known as co-inventor (with Bob Scheifler) of MIT's X

Window System.</p>

<p>Gettys says he got much of his network applications experience working on X,

which is a &quot;network transparent window system in which you can run

applications on any machine in a network, something that Microsoft can't

say.&quot; Gettys is proud of X and should be. I think of X as the previous

generation, just before the Web -- of thin-client Internet software. Now Gettys

is back with HTTP/1.1.</p>

<p>Harvard's Scott Bradner, another prominent Internet plumber, agrees that

Gettys' work on HTTP/1.1 is pivotal.</p>

<p>&quot;Jim Gettys has been able to help bring peace to the IETF/W3C standards

picture,&quot; Bradner says. &quot;He has just the right ability to get these

types of ego-filled organizations to agree on how to divide up the work -- a

very important ability if we are to make progress rather than making redundant

protocol proposals.&quot; Bradner suggests we be clear that Gettys' HTTP work is

done under the auspices of the IETF, not the W3C, not Digital, and certainly not

MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science -- spoken like the 32-year Harvard man

that Bradner is. You can find more about HTTP/1.1 at <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols">http://www.w3.org/Protocols</a>.</p>

<p>In short, HTTP is the protocol by which your Web browser downloads pages when

you give it a URL. Unfortunately, HTTP/1.0 opens and closes a TCP connection for

each element of each Web page -- each block of text, each graphic -- and there

are lots of them. HTTP downloading generates a large number of TCP opening and

closing IP packets, which carry no data and waste a lot of time. Further, the

connections that HTTP opens give TCP's congestion-control mechanisms too little

time to work. The result is that all-too-familiar bogging down of Web response,

many lost packets, and frequent recourse to your browser's Stop button. And

HTTP's abuse of TCP/IP is only the beginning.</p>

<h3>Next-generation HTTP</h3>

<p>When the Web was only a physicist's dream in 1990, HTTP/1.0 was just fine,

and that's a gross understatement. But as Marc Andreessen, Netscape, and you all

have taken the Web to its dizzying heights, HTTP/1.0 sticks out like a sore

thumb. Hence the need for the IETF to develop a &quot;next generation&quot; of

HTTP (called HTTPng at <a href="http://www.ietf.org">http://www.ietf.org</a>),

and in the meantime, a very important upgrade called HTTP/1.1.</p>

<p>We gathered the HTTP/1.1 team on a large conference call and asked them what

would do the most good for the Internet's leaky plumbing. They said I should

encourage you to ask your suppliers of Internet server software and browsers to

deploy good implementations of HTTP/1.1. Ask for it by name. Various

implementations of HTTP/1.1 are now available in the major Web browsers and

servers.</p>

<p>But according to Gettys, it is too easy to do &quot;a compliant

implementation of HTTP/1.1 which has most of the bad properties of 1.0 ... a

good implementation does persistent connections, pipelining, and

buffering.&quot; Not only does a good implementation of HTTP/1.1 reduce the

Internet-clogging packets generated by your Web downloads -- by 50 percent to 90

percent -- but when your HTTP/1.1-equipped browser hits an HTTP/1.1-equipped

server, you'll see a substantial speeding up of Web access, reducing download

times by 20 percent to 75 percent, Gettys says.</p>
